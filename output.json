        "description": "As the last spasms of Tropical Storm Beryl head toward Vermont — a year after last summer’s devastating floods — meteorologists are increasingly confident that the incoming clouds will loosen a quick, heavy downpour on the state.  So quick, in fact, that the storm appears unlikely to result in the widespread flooding of last July, according to a forecast issued Tuesday morning by the National Weather Service. Rather, it is more likely to cause flash floods wherever rain is heaviest.  “Last year it was a marathon. This year it’s more of a sprint,” said Robert Haynes, a meteorologist at the Burlington branch of the National Weather Service.  The bulk of the rain is expected to fall Wednesday afternoon and night, according to the forecast, with most of the state getting 1-3 inches. That’s a far cry from the 3-9 inches that fell over two days last July. The issue this time around, according to Haynes, is that the rain is likely to strike in a shorter, 6- to 12-hour window.  “We’re looking at less rain, but in a shorter time-frame,” Haynes said. “So, that would mean flash flooding in narrower regions, rather than statewide.” There could, however, be parts of the state that receive 3-4 inches, and within those, “there could be a few spots that approach 5 inches,” according to the forecast. If those quantities materialize, the forecast warns about the possibility of “additional flooding across low-lying plains and roads,” on top of the flash flooding worries.  Though the when and how much of the storm are relatively clear at this point, pinpointing exactly where the heaviest rains will strike remains a challenge, according to Haynes. The major issue, he said, is the difference between the two types of prediction models the weather service uses for its forecasts.  The global-scale models, which cover the entirety of the planet, place the heaviest rains in the north of the state, along the Canadian border. But the larger scope of those models means they have lower resolution for specific regions, and as such they “can’t really resolve things like thunderstorms,” according to Haynes.   The high-resolution regional models differ widely, placing the heaviest rains in southern Vermont. But though these models “give you a better sense of the maximum precipitation amounts,” according to Haynes, they’re still quite iffy when it comes to accurately predicting location.  “Our current forecast is a blend between the two,” said Haynes.  Tim Humphrey, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Albany, New York office, which covers southern Vermont, said that until the storm came closer, the discrepancies between the models would persist.  “Once we get into that 24-hour time frame we should have much more certainty,” said Humphrey.  One thing the models do agree on is that the skies should clear up fast on Thursday, with dry air scattering the rain. But with the soil in central and northern Vermont having absorbed “150-200% above normal” rain levels in the past 40 days, runoff could make the rivers rise.  According to the forecast, “a reasonable worst case scenario would support the potential for minor flooding at the Mad River at Moretown, the Winooski River at Essex Junction, Otter Creek at Center Rutland and the East Branch Ausable River at Ausable Forks.”  Haynes recommended drivers avoid roads at risk of flooding, such as North Williston Road in Essex Junction and South Creek Road in Rutland. Haynes put the chances of that worst-case scenario panning out at 10%.   ",

        "description": "Updated at 6:02 p.m. On July 10 last year, heavy rains that had begun the night before unleashed catastrophic floods across Vermont.  This Wednesday, exactly a year later, torrential downpours may once again threaten the state with flooding, according to a forecast issued Monday by the National Weather Service.  The culprit? The collision of Tropical Storm Beryl with the hot, humid air already hanging over the state, according to Seth Kutikoff, a meteorologist for the Burlington branch of the National Weather Service. “This fuels heavy rain and thunderstorms,” said Kutikoff. And although the current expectation is a widespread 1 to 2 inches of rain — with some areas getting 2 to 4 inches — there “are increasing indications” the state could see up to 4 to 6 inches between Wednesday and Friday mornings, according to the weather service, “with isolated 6 to 8 inches” in some towns.  If that materializes, the rainfall “would be comparable” to the 3 to 9 inches that fell during a 48-hour-period last July, causing widespread flooding throughout the state, according to the weather service forecast. A big concern, according to Kutikoff, is that much of northern Vermont has seen twice the amount of rainfall it typically gets around this time of year. Similar conditions were present ahead of last summer’s flooding. “The soil in some localized areas can’t absorb any more water,” said Kutikoff.  Still, Kutikoff emphasized that, as of Monday, it remained a worst-case scenario that this week’s flooding could rival last summer’s.  “We are not expecting anywhere near the coverage and total amounts of rain we saw last year,” he said.  The most likely outcome is isolated flash floods in areas that sustain the most rain, according to Kutikoff. He is keeping his eye on an east-west line running from Essex County through southern Orleans, Caledonia, Lamoille and Chittenden counties. “That doesn’t mean there will be flash floods there, just that that’s where the highest risk of them is,” said Kutikoff.  Mark Bosma, a spokesperson for Vermont Emergency Management, said Monday afternoon that the state was monitoring the storm and that the weather service’s forecasts over the following 24 hours would go a long way toward clarifying the severity of the situation.  Bosma said that officials would likely determine Tuesday the extent to which VEM would activate the State Emergency Operations Center, which acts as a hub to coordinate the government’s response to emergencies.  If a town manager needs to close a road, for example, the center connects them with the Agency of Transportation, according to Bosma. If a town needs an emergency shelter, the center connects it with the Agency of Human Services.  “Last summer we had representatives from state agencies on call 24/7,” Bosma said. “It’s scalable.” For the public, the most important thing is being prepared before any possible emergency happens, according to Bosma.  “If you live in low-lying areas, get a go-bag. Have extra canned goods and water on hand. Map out a route to higher ground,” he said.   And according to Kutikoff, though people should not be too concerned about living through a repeat of last summer, taking precautions is always a good idea. He recommended avoiding roads at risk of flash flooding on Wednesday and Thursday and checking weather service forecasts frequently, since conditions could change for better or for worse.  “There’s still a chance that the heavier rains go up to southern Canada, and there’s still a possibility that rainfall could increase over Vermont,” said Kutikoff.

        "description": "The state has requested a damage assessment from the Federal Emergency Management Agency after significant flooding occurred in Lamoille county and the Northeast Kingdom region on June 23. “The storm trained on pockets of the state, resulting in severe damage to roads and other public infrastructure in the impacted communities,” Vermont Emergency Management Director Eric Forand said in a press release issued Monday.  The state’s assessment indicates that associated damages could amount to more than $1.5 million, according to the release. This figure is just the beginning, according to Mark Bosma, a spokesperson for Vermont Emergency Management.  “We just have a preliminary number, and that gets (FEMA) here,” he said. He said the most affected towns had been Stowe and Walden, though there have been reports of damage elsewhere. On June 23, the National Weather service placed the entire state under a tornado watch. Harry Shepard, Stowe’s public works director, called the localized, intense storm that hit his area a “microburst.”  It took until the night of June 25 to restore basic access to homes and emergency services, according to Shepard. Even now, repairs are far from over.  “Frankly, I think it’s going to be another month or two,” he said. Once the roads were patched up, deeper structural harm remained in some areas. Two expensive large-diameter culverts, crucial to managing runoff, have been damaged as well. Replacing the affected areas may mean constructing several small bridges where the culverts once were, Shepard said. All told, it could cost millions, he said. Shepard said the town’s stormwater infrastructure is extremely vulnerable right now. “When you’re worried about heavy rain,” he said, “it’s stressful.” He’s relieved that the additional rain on June 29th didn’t do more damage. But for Shepard, the next flooding disaster never seems far away. “It absolutely appears to be happening more frequently,” he said. Last July, historic flooding across the state caused severe damage in many Vermont communities. December saw another round of damaging floods caused by rain and snowmelt. Debbie Messier, the town clerk in Walden, said the town was still feeling the effects of previous disasters. “We were still trying to play catch-up from last year,” she said. Walden only regained full access to its roads on Monday. Several were completely washed out, and multiple culverts needed replacing. Walden’s two-person repair crew and hired reinforcements have been working intensely, according to Messier.  Messier only had a rough sense of what the repairs will cost. “Nothing compared to last July, but it’s definitely enough,” she said. Elsewhere in the state, other isolated damage occurred. Elaine Cashin, the town clerk in Westmore, confirmed that a small landslide occurred by Route 5A on June 23 as a result of the storm.  FEMA officials will arrive to inspect various sites from this most recent report on July 8, according to Bosma. If a major disaster is declared based on that assessment, 75% of the cost to qualifying areas would be covered federally, according to Vermont Emergency Management. The state plans to modify its estimates of the severity of the damage as it receives more information. “We need towns to report damage to us,” Bosma said. Correction: A previous headline for this story incorrectly stated what the state was requesting from FEMA. Photo captions in an earlier version of this story misspelled Kestrel Owens’ surname. ",

        "description": "This is Part 3 of Downstream, a 10-part series looking at what’s changed — and what hasn’t — one year after catastrophic floods swept through Vermont. A year ago, as historic levels of rain fell and rivers jumped their banks, Vermont’s dams felt the full force of the flooding.  At least five small dams failed entirely. Around 50 dams, at least, sustained damage requiring repairs by the state Agency of Natural Resources. And at key state flood control dams — Waterbury, East Barre and Wrightsville — water levels reached record or near-record highs, alarming residents who lived downstream. For Vermonters living along waterways or beneath dams, last summer’s historic flooding drew attention to the state’s network of dams — hundreds of structures, many old, decaying or forgotten, dotting the state’s rivers and streams.    The disaster helped spark a sweeping reappraisal of how the state manages its waterways and the structures built on them. Now, new legislation, as well as an influx of state funding and a suite of new rules, are slated to dramatically reshape how Vermont oversees its dams. “It’s a big deal,” Neil Kamman, the director of the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation’s Water Investment Division, said in an interview. “The dam safety program is evolving significantly, in a good direction.” Last July, as torrential rainfall soaked Vermont, water rose precipitously behind the state’s Winooski River flood control dams — Waterbury, Wrightsville and East Barre.  “If water (at Wrightsville) exceeds capacity, the first spillway will release water into the North Branch River,” Montpelier City Manager Bill Fraser warned on Facebook on July 11, 2023. “This has never happened since the dam was built so there is no precedent for potential damage. There would be a large amount of water coming into Montpelier which would drastically add to the existing flood damage.”  State officials scrambled to get personnel to monitor the structures, and despite several false alarms and high anxiety in downstream communities, the dams held fast.  “At the end of the day, we’re actually pretty fortunate with how everything performed,” Ben Green, an engineer and the section chief of the Department of Environmental Conservation’s dam safety program, said in an interview. “But we had probably more close calls than we should have had.” In the aftermath of the floods, those close calls came into focus. In the two weeks following the flooding, state inspectors — as well as dam safety personnel called in from New York and Massachusetts — assessed nearly 400 dams across the state, Green told lawmakers in presentations last winter. State inspectors found that five dams — in Woodbury, Wallingford, Peru, Cabot and Washington — had failed, meaning they were effectively destroyed. Another 50 dams sustained “notable damage,” according to Department of Environmental Conservation data. The state estimates that 57 dams were overtopped by floodwaters.  At the Wrightsville and East Barre dams, officials recorded record-high water levels, with floodwaters rising to within 10 inches of the Wrightsville Dam’s auxiliary spillway. The Waterbury Dam, meanwhile, recorded its fourth-highest water level on record.  Officials said that the flooding provided something of a wake-up call. After hearing testimony about the impact of the flood on Vermont’s dams, Sen. Chris Bray, D-Addison, the chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, thought, “How do we not have this happen again?” he said. “We are understaffed, and then the weather is more and more violent, making us more and more susceptible” to flooding, Bray said in an interview. “So how do we build a long-term pathway out of here?” In this year’s legislative session, that pathway largely took the form of Act 121, a sweeping law regulating development near waterways, improving wetlands conservation and strengthening dam safety. Lawmakers added four positions to the dam safety program and made two others permanent, bringing the total number of state dam safety staff from five to nine — a much-needed boost for the program, officials said. The legislation will also correct what critics say is an inconsistency in the state’s dam oversight system. Currently, the state Agency of Natural Resources’ Department of Environmental Conservation has jurisdiction over roughly 1,000 dams, while another 21 hydropower dams fall under the purview of the state Public Utility Commission. (Dozens of others are regulated by federal agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Park Service, among others.)  Act 121 brings the Public Utility Commission’s dams under the jurisdiction of the Department of Environmental Conservation by 2028, unless they qualify for federal oversight. That change will standardize two different processes — a disparity that has sometimes caused anxiety for dams’ neighbors.  The Legislature also added $4 million to a pot of money,  the Dam Safety Revolving Loan Fund, to fund the removal of dams that could pose a threat to communities downstream.  Previously, Vermont’s dam safety loan fund was much smaller, and could only be tapped in emergencies. Act 121, however, allows dam owners to access money for dam removal or renovation even before it’s urgently needed. That funding, officials said, will allow landowners — who might not otherwise have the resources to remove dams — to access forgivable state loans to get rid of potentially hazardous structures.  Karina Dailey, a restoration ecologist at the Vermont Natural Resources Council, said that in the aftermath of last July’s record rainfall, multiple landowners reached out seeking to get rid of dams on their property. After the floods, “there was a noticeable difference in people calling who had dams on their property who no longer wanted them,” Dailey said.  Deconstructing dams is not only safer for downstream communities, said Dailey, who runs the nonprofit’s dam removal program, it’s also a boon for the health of stream ecosystems. “Certainly a removed dam is the best dam, in our opinion,” she said. Outside of the Legislature, officials are using other strategies to improve the state of Vermont’s dams. The Waterbury Dam is already undergoing a multi-year renovation, a collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to upgrade deteriorating concrete and flood gates. That project, which is currently estimated to cost roughly $80 million, is scheduled for completion in 2029.   Vermont’s Department of Environmental Conservation is also in communication with the Corps about making potential improvements to the Wrightsville and East Barre dams. Officials are considering renovations that would allow the dams to release water more quickly in order to build capacity ahead of expected rainfall.  That process is still in its early stages, and it’s not clear if or when such improvements would take place. And even before last summer’s flooding, state officials were drafting new rules governing dams. New regulations will strengthen the state’s oversight of dams owned by other entities, giving state officials the authority to compel dam owners to inspect and remediate the structures. “They are a big deal,” Kamman said. Once they go fully into effect, “the state will be in a position of saying, okay, owner, your dam was found to be in poor condition. It poses a risk to downstream residents. It’s not imminent, but it is a significant risk, and you need to do X, Y and Z in order to make this safe. That’s enforceable.” Green, the dam safety engineer, told lawmakers in the past legislative session that the new rules amounted to a “paradigm shift in terms of how dams are regulated in the state.” After delays caused both by Covid-19 and last year’s flooding, the regulations are scheduled to take effect next summer.  State officials and lawmakers say the reforms, all in all, are the product of a need to keep adapting. Climate change is exacerbating flooding in Vermont, experts say, forcing state policymakers to continually adapt to heavier rainfall and more frequent deluges — events that will put further pressure on Vermont’s dams.  “We’re just living in a different climate,” said Bray, the chair of the Senate Natural Resources and Energy committee. “And we had not adapted our laws and planning practices to keep up with the hazards that we’re facing.” ",

        "description": "New England’s grid operators are expecting the demand for electricity to grow by 17% in the coming decade, and they attribute much of that growth to new electric vehicles hitting the road, according to a new report. In fact, electric vehicles are likely to contribute more to the growth in electrical demand than any other factor, according to a new forecast by ISO New England, the nonprofit organization that operates the interconnected electric grid in all six New England states.  Overall, grid operators expect New England’s electricity consumption to grow by about 17% in the next decade, or about 1.7% per year. They assume some of the growth will be offset by solar arrays on the consumer’s side of the grid, and by increased efficiency measures — for example, insulating a home.  More electric heat pumps and other changes in the heating sector are also likely to increase electrical demand, according to the report. The forecasted growth in electricity demand comes largely from policy changes. Local, state and federal leaders are urging and incentivizing people to electrify their cars, homes and businesses in an effort to reduce emissions from fossil fuels, which cause climate change.  “Every state has roadmaps and mandates,” said Victoria Rojo, a lead data scientist with ISO New England. “It really runs the gamut. And then there’s specific municipalities that have goals, you know, for X number of school buses or whatever. There’s a lot of different things out there.” One of the biggest policies driving the change is Advanced Clean Cars II, a rule first adopted by California, which requires all passenger cars and light-duty trucks delivered by manufacturers to sell in the state be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. Vermont and 16 other states have also adopted the regulation, according to California’s Air Resources Board.  While the policies are in place to reduce climate change-causing emissions, much of New England’s power is still generated by natural gas.  On Friday morning, real-time data on ISO New England’s website showed that the grid’s power sources included 47% natural gas and 31% nuclear power. Renewable energy (which ISO New England defines as solar, wind, refuse, wood and landfill gas) made up 17% of the mix, and hydro accounted for another 5%.  Most utilities in Vermont purchase a large percentage of their power from renewable sources, but not all of those sources plug directly into the New England grid.  In order to increase renewable energy within New England’s grid, utilities will need to find ways to store more power, Rojo said.  Renewable energy sources have “inherent variability in their energy production, so then having sufficient battery resources or energy storage resources to balance all of that is crucial,” she said. “Those pieces have to work together in order to overall reduce or to meet the decarbonization goals.” Kristin Carlson, a spokesperson for Green Mountain Power, Vermont’s largest electric utility, said the company is already working to build out its battery storage — and that wider adoption of electric vehicles could actually help the cause.  “Electric vehicles, they are the solution for the grid, because more electrification through electric vehicles lowers costs for everybody, and they are a highly manageable new load,” she said. She called electric vehicles “batteries on wheels,” and said the company has a program that provides reduced charging rates to the equivalent of $1.20 per gallon in exchange for allowing the utility to turn chargers off during peak energy usage periods. (Participants are notified in advance through text and can opt out, but Carlson said the utility tries to make sure the timing is convenient for most people, and the opt-out rate is low).  In the future, the utility is planning to launch a program to borrow energy from electric vehicles batteries during high usage times — something it’s already doing with school buses in South Burlington.  So far, Green Mountain Power has set up a “virtual power plant” with a combination of batteries that includes utility-scale systems, batteries in homes and electric vehicles, Carlson said. It adds up to 55 megawatts, roughly enough to power more than 15,000 homes.  Battery storage helps mitigate climate change by supporting renewable energy, she said. It also helps residents stay resilient during storms by creating back-up power systems.  “What’s important to have as we face climate change — as we address the changing climate and more severe weather that’s causing more outages and putting people at risk — is energy generated closer to where it’s used, paired with battery storage,” she said. “It’s the way to keep everyone connected.” Correction: An earlier version of this story used incorrect figures for the anticipated increase in electricity demand.

        "description": "This story by Tommy Gardner was first published in the Stowe Reporter on June 27. A powerful summer storm that settled Sunday afternoon over Stowe’s eastern flank brought about three inches of rain in 30 minutes, overwhelming the Gold Brook and its many tributaries, washing out roads, driveways, culverts and bridges and stranding folks literally cut off from the rest of town. According to Stowe Public Works Director Harry Shepard, no one was injured, but the extent of damage to town infrastructure won’t be known for a while, at least until crews can finish their initial mitigation efforts. On Monday night — at the end of a 15-hour workday that followed a late Sunday night and preceded an even longer, sunny and breezy Tuesday — Shepard described the initial response as “tourniquet-level work” just to get roads open to one lane. “It’s been an all-hands-on-deck day with contractors and our guys,” Shepard said. Although rain fell over much of the region all weekend, and particularly Sunday, it was especially potent all along the Worcester Range. Although the damage could be seen all along Route 100 between Randolph Road and Stowe village — trees down in front yard after front yard and grass and nascent corn crops flattened — the real damage came in the tucked away areas. Practically the whole of Stowe Hollow was affected, as was Moss Glen Falls Road. North Hollow Road no longer resembled a road, as the nearby Gold Brook quickly jumped its banks and turned the dirt byway into a parallel tributary for a brief half hour. A brand-new stretch of pavement on Stowe Hollow Road was undercut by rain, leaving a lengthy chasm with a blacktop overhang. “A tremendous amount of water came off the Worcester Range,” Shepard said. By the end of the day Tuesday, all roads except for Moss Glen Falls were at least open to one lane, but the town’s public safety department was urging people to keep off them and reserve them for emergency access. The Commodores Inn opened its doors for emergency lodging. Shepard said a couple of families took them up on the offer, but most people hung tight and waited for crews to do their work. He said he’s not sure how much financial assistance the town will get, since emergency declarations are done on a county-level basis, and he’s not sure anyone in Lamoille County got hit nearly as hard as Stowe. For a while on Sunday, tornado warnings lit up weather alerts, although the National Weather Service did not report any twisters touching down. Shepard, who already dealt with two floods last year, this week recycled a line that he had used when describing the not-infrequent rebuilding efforts public works departments have been tasked with in recent years. “We’re putting Humpty back together again. Again,” he said. Lance Purnell lives on Upper Hollow Road directly across from the intersection with North Hollow Road, where the Gold Brook crosses under the road and runs alongside his property. Sunday, it ran all over his property. Purnell said he’s lived at the house for 32 years and, while he’s seen the Gold Brook reach flood stage, he’s never seen such massive quantities of water come down at him in such a short period of time. “That brook was coming up fast,” he said, estimating he saw 3 inches of rain in 30 minutes. That tracks with what Shepard heard. “Everybody that I talked to who has rain gauges said it was basically two and a half inches of rain, but it occurred in half an hour,” he said. Right at the roadside edge of Purnell’s property, the large metal culvert — tall enough for a modest-sized adult to walk through upright — filled up nearly to the top, until big logs blocked the other side and sent the water over the road. “There was a river coming down North Hollow Road. It had to be over a foot deep coming down the road,” he said. “I’ve never seen that.” As the river started to rise, Purnell went out to gather some items left near the river — a pair of inflatable bird-shaped “floaties” that he and his family like sit in to cool off in the river, and a garden cart that he typically hitches to his lawn tractor. He was able to rescue the floaties but, as he went to haul the cart closer to the house, he got hit on the back of his knees by a wave of water that swept up and over the road, challenging him to a tug-of-war he simply couldn’t win. The cart was swept away. “Do I want my cart, or do I want to die? So, I just let go of the cart,” Purnell said. “It wasn’t ‘scary’ scary, but I knew enough not to screw around.” On Monday, Purnell’s inflatable toys sat safe and sound, bright pink and white amid an expanse of gray silt that used to be green lawn. Purnell said there was at least 10 inches of riverbed and dirt road material deposited on the lawn, and his driveway got wiped out, the gentle slope down from Stowe Hollow Road turned into a small cliff. His backyard garden was washed away, and his drinking water well got contaminated, but neither he nor his wife were injured, nor was the house damaged, minus an inch or so of water in the basement that entered through a basement window. By noon Monday, landscaper and excavator Martin Werth had nearly filled the driveway back up to grade so the Purnells could get their vehicles in and out. Purnell said folks around the Hollow tend to help each other out of scrapes. “It’s all good. Been here a long time and helped a lot of people over the years,” he said. “This is my turn, I guess.” Monday, dump truck after dump truck emblazoned with the Dale E. Percy, Inc. logo made their way up to the Hollow carrying full beds of dirt, like a massive diesel bucket brigade. When it was observed that as many as 50 trucks had passed by the Stowe Reporter office on School Street, a Percy employee laughed and said that was likely a considerably low estimate — they had been operating since dawn that day and didn’t stop until dusk. There were signs scattered all throughout Stowe Hollow warning folks to stay off the roads unless they lived there or were part of the response network. Many folks took to walking the neighborhood, whether to check on neighbors or to gawk and snap photos and videos. The paucity of passenger vehicles highlighted just how busy parcel deliverers remain even after a natural disaster. Several UPS and FedEx trucks could be seen, trying to navigate an already-complicated network of roads that invariably end in the word Hollow — Stowe Hollow, North Hollow, Upper Hollow, Upper Hollow Hill, South Hollow, Hollow’s End. Picking her way more confidently through the wreckage was postal driver Annette Nisbet. Monday, she headed up North Hollow Road and stopped to chat with resident Brad James, handing him his mail through the window of her vibrant blue Jeep. Nisbet said she delivers to 782 boxes on her route, but this day that number was likely to be smaller. Not for lack of trying. “I’ll get to an area where they’re working and the guys on the crew are like, ‘You’re not gonna make it.’ And I’m like, ‘You wanna bet?’” Nisbet said. “Just four-wheel drive it and go.” Positivity and sturdy tires can only get you so far, though. Just a minute or two after continuing up North Hollow Road, Nisbet was headed back down, thwarted by forces greater than 285 horsepower. She waved cheerfully from her passenger-side perch. ",

        "description": "This is Part 2 of Downstream, a 10-part series looking at what’s changed — and what hasn’t — one year after catastrophic floods swept through Vermont. JOHNSON — Standing inside this town’s wastewater treatment plant on a recent afternoon, Thomas Galinat pointed to the cracks in the walls and jury-rigged electronics. The plant’s offices sit empty — never put back together, he said, after the building filled with eight feet of water during last July’s devastating floods. Its wastewater treatment operations were knocked out for about a month, during which local officials said they had no choice but to pump untreated sewage into the Lamoille and Gihon rivers, which meet at an oxbow just a few hundred feet down the hill.  Today the facility, while operational, remains in a state of limbo as officials contemplate its future. The key question: Should Johnson keep the wastewater plant where it is, making structural changes to improve its flood resilience? Or, should it undertake the costly endeavor of rebuilding the flood-prone facility elsewhere?  The answer will have impacts far beyond its walls, said Galinat, the town administrator.  “This, here, is the linchpin for the entire future of Johnson,” he said. Johnson’s downtown is also built around the Lamoille and Gihon rivers, and the post office, public library and sole grocery store all filled with floodwater last July. The damage these and other buildings sustained has led some officials to wonder whether it even makes sense to fully reconstruct the heart of the town where it is.  “How do you maintain a downtown when the downtown is at risk?” Galinat said. “We were always on the river. But if you can’t be on the river anymore, where is the future of Johnson going to be?”  Johnson’s wastewater plant was one of 33 whose operations were impacted by last summer’s flooding. In the year since, all of the damaged facilities have resumed normal operations, according to a state Agency of Natural Resources spokesperson. Stephanie Brackin said in an email that state officials met in recent weeks with leaders in Johnson — as well as in Hardwick and Ludlow, two other towns that were among those hardest hit by last summer’s flooding — to discuss the feasibility of relocating their sewage plants, among other options. The wastewater plant in Johnson has flooded at least three times since it was built in 1995, according to Tim Hall, who’s worked at the plant for the past six years. One of those floods happened just two weeks before the plant, which is owned and operated by the Village of Johnson, was set to open, he said. “It’s going to flood again,” Hall said. “What are you going to do?” But Johnson officials are in a holding pattern until the Federal Emergency Management Administration decides whether the government will pay for improvements at the existing plant, or whether access to federal funds will instead be contingent on building a new plant elsewhere.  A new plant would cost at least $25 million, Galinat said. He said engineers are currently working out final designs and cost estimates for both options, with a report expected later this year. FEMA needs that report before making the call on funding, according to local and state and local officials. At this point, “it doesn’t matter what the answer is,” the town administrator said. But without an answer, he said, “the town can’t move forward with its other projects.” There is more riding on FEMA’s decision than it might seem. That’s because preliminary work has shown that the most feasible location for a new plant is farther up the hill — where the town and village of Johnson’s municipal office building is located. The first floor of the municipal building was flooded out last July, too. And while the resulting damage has largely been repaired, officials have held off on making further improvements and fully reopening the building to the public, according to Galinat, in case they need to tear it down in order to build a new wastewater plant.  The first floor of the municipal building is still mostly empty. Offices for both town and village staff, as well as a makeshift meeting space for local boards, have been consolidated on the second floor. It’s a sea of desks and chairs and wires and papers with little privacy.  Galinat prefers the quiet of the first floor. Every day, he brings his work equipment in and out of the building in a cardboard box; he sits down at a folding chair and a folding table, the same table that also gets used upstairs for selectboard meetings. Before the flooding, the building’s second floor served as a community meeting space, hosting everything from sewing nights to the local chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous. A back room was the town’s de facto senior center. But since last July, those groups have had to meet elsewhere.  Town officials have heard repeatedly from locals who are frustrated about the continued lack of public meeting space, Galinat said. He’s not always sure how to explain the town’s position — and he worries that the situation is eroding trust in local government. Another blow to community space in Johnson, according to Galinat: The town hasn’t had a grocery store since its sole market suffered heavy damage in last summer’s flooding. The owners of Sterling Market said last fall that they would not reopen the store, which sits along the Gihon River’s shore. Earlier this year, though, the building’s owner said that the New England grocery chain Shaw’s was interested in opening up a location there.  The town administrator said that can’t come soon enough. “With the store, people would come here and you might also grab dinner. You might go to the bank,” he said, walking along Main Street past the former store, where the only marker left of its presence is a faint outline of its name above the front door.  “Now,” Galinat continued, “you see less traffic downtown because the core hub — the market — isn’t getting people from surrounding towns into Johnson.” Other public buildings in Johnson have reopened, to varying degrees. The town’s post office, which is in the same building as the former grocery store, came back online in December. Three months earlier, the town opened a temporary public library in the basement of the Masonic lodge, after its 100-plus-year-old library flooded in July. The library building on Railroad Street — probably the worst-hit block in town — is still largely gutted, except for some new insulation. The town has applied for a state grant to fund an ambitious plan to pick the building up off its foundation and move it somewhere less vulnerable to major flooding, though work hasn’t started yet. On a recent afternoon at the temporary space, library director Jeanne Engel was busy helping a group of young children check out books. She sat at a small folding table draped in a tablecloth, with colorful curtains strung up behind her. The curtains cloak piles of boxes holding the majority of the library’s roughly 15,000-book collection.  Engel has lived in Johnson for four decades. She said it’s well past time for the town to seriously consider where it builds its key public facilities, like the one she runs. “I think a lot of people are just going to put things back the way it was before. And I just think, personally, that we need to not continue to rebuild on the floodplain — as far as buildings and infrastructure,” she said, as Galinat stood nearby, nodding his head. While Engel’s home wasn’t damaged in the flooding, many others were. About 190 households or individuals in Johnson applied for FEMA aid, according to federal data, and aid recipients in town have since received about $1 million from the agency.  At the same time, several local leaders said that some people packed up after the flooding and never came back to their damaged houses or apartments. According to data from the Lamoille Area Recovery Network — one of the long-term support groups set up statewide after the flooding — 17% of primary homeowners in Lamoille County who applied for FEMA aid have since moved, and more than half have left Lamoille County. Galinat said the town is considering buying out certain properties that back up to Lamoille and Gihon rivers through a joint federal and state program. He said officials need to seriously consider whether a community built around two waterways can stay that way in the decades to come. But those big conversations are only just starting, he said. Recovery is still not over. Just a few weeks ago, public works staff from the town and village cleared a final trove of water-damaged records out of the vault in the municipal offices, which filled with a foot of water last summer. A large air purifier was still running in the room. Galinat said the cleanup was a marker of progress, albeit a small one. It had some symbolic value, too, he said.  The town and village governments have long had “a pretty contentious relationship,” he explained. But the flood has forced officials to work arm-in-arm over the past year — and in the case of a flood-damaged building, to work in the same room. “You’re forcing cooperation,” Galinat said. “Anything we do, we have to do together.” ",

        "description": "This is Part 1 of Downstream, a 10-part series looking at what’s changed — and what hasn’t — one year after catastrophic floods swept through Vermont. How do you commemorate one of the most destructive floods in state history? A year after 2011’s Tropical Storm Irene, Vermonters could count the ways. Brattleboro, for example, screened “Singin’ in the Rain” in a once waterlogged theater. Pittsfield hosted a potluck picnic on the green where all 546 townspeople had huddled when their lone highway washed away. And Newfane crowned a pregnant resident who had settled there amid the storm as its “Queen Irene” before joining her for a parade on a newly rebuilt road. “We think she’s the perfect symbol of new life,” an organizer explained. A dozen years later, the Green Mountain State is set to mark the first anniversary of what the National Weather Service calls “The Great Vermont Flood of July 2023,” which recorded up to 9 inches of rainfall and ravaged more than $600 million in property from Athens in the south to Walden in the Northeast Kingdom. But don’t expect balloons or banners. “We are not planning any events,” said Sheila Duranleau, chair of the Washington Selectboard. “We are working tirelessly on reimbursement and rebuilding.” Ditto in Sutton: “We would like to just move on from it all,” said Patti McClure, the town clerk and treasurer. And the same in Holland: “Praying this doesn’t happen again,” said Diane Judd, local administrator and president of the Vermont Municipal Clerks and Treasurers Association. State officials are preparing to remember the floods that began last July 10 with what Gov. Phil Scott calls “a day of reflection.” But locally, most communities are feeling more cautious than celebratory. “Recovering from this historic, devastating natural disaster is still very much a part of our daily lives,” said Montpelier City Manager Bill Fraser, whose municipal office building is one of many that has reopened yet remains under repair. Cabot is a rare town set to offer an event. A year after its century-old Willey municipal building flooded, a July 13 gathering there will recognize efforts surrounding not only the cleanup, but also future storm mitigation. “We’re celebrating community resilience,” said Amanda Otto, an organizer from the Cabot Public Library. “I thought it would be a missed opportunity not to do something.” A citizen recovery committee that calls itself “Community Resilience for the Waterbury Area” (or CReW) is hoping to hold some sort of observance “to honor everything folks have been and are still going through,” according to member Liz Schlegel. “This has been a long haul,” Schlegel said, “with flooding in July and then again in December for many.” Indeed, municipalities faced multiple floods last year, complicating the scheduling of any observance. “Whereas Irene was like a slap in the face in a single day, communities around Vermont might place this year’s anniversaries very differently,” said Doug Farnham, the state’s chief recovery officer. Barton, for example, is planning a “History and Resilience Week” in August. “We’ll lift up all the neat stuff happening in the community,” said Allyson Howell of the sponsoring group Northeast Kingdom Organizing. But most other localities are too busy trying to rebound to mark anything at any time.  Consider Weston. Its central former church turned playhouse was spared by the state’s biggest natural disaster, the Flood of 1927. Hit hard by Irene, the building was repaired and reopened within months. But last summer’s repeat performance has closed the landmark until at least 2026 so caretakers can gird for the long term. “As much as I wish we could say, ‘Let’s get back in there as soon as possible,’ the hard truth is we could be looking at floods of a significant scale happening with greater frequency,” said Susanna Gellert, head of the Weston Theater Company that has relocated to its Walker Farm second stage. “We need to do this right.” “Climate change” wasn’t a household word a century ago when the state commemorated the first anniversary of the Flood of 1927, a still-unmatched calamity that recorded up to 15 inches of rain, 84 deaths and what historians estimate would total about $4 billion in damage today. “The anniversary of this deluge is not a thing to celebrate but rather to be remembered as the date of a painful visitation for which the people of the state were in no way responsible,” Ludlow’s Vermont Tribune wrote a year later on Nov. 2, 1928. “It was beyond their power to avert it.” Long before the 1979 creation of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1927 flood crews on the cusp of winter could do little more than patch highways until spring. The primitive condition of most Green Mountain roads — fewer than 100 miles were “hard-surfaced,” with the rest being dirt or gravel — spurred Vermont to modernize its infrastructure, leading to the birth of the current state highway system. “Sweeping as were the losses and devastation, what a different picture we see now, just one short year since the catastrophe,” the Barre Times reported on Nov. 2, 1928. “We see a Vermont that is largely restored in its material aspects. We see business resumed to its normal point in nearly every instance. We see railroad trains running where there was nothing but yawning gulfs on November 4 last. We see roads restored and even made better.” That changed upon the arrival of 2011’s Tropical Storm Irene, which dumped up to 11 inches of rain, claimed seven lives and destroyed nearly $750 million in property — a figure equal to almost two-thirds of that year’s state general fund budget, according to state statistics. In the days after the storm, then-Gov. Peter Shumlin crisscrossed the state by National Guard helicopter as workers repaired such crumbled north-south arteries as Route 100 — the state’s longest — and severed east-west corridors including Route 9 linking Bennington and Brattleboro and Route 4 connecting Rutland and White River Junction. On Irene’s first anniversary a year later, Shumlin traded the whirlybird for wheels. “The state rebuilt more than 500 miles of damaged road,” he explained, “and we want to use them.” Shumlin’s travels revealed both progress and lingering problems.  “We have so much to be proud of — and so much more work to do,” he said in 2012. “This is an opportunity not only to commemorate the extraordinary response of Vermonters but also to rededicate ourselves to those who are still struggling.” A year after the July 2023 storm clouds dropped as much as two months of rain in a couple of days — leading to two deaths and an unknown yet highly seen number of displaced individuals and institutions — state officials are voicing similar sentiments. “We’ve come a long ways,” Scott said at a recent press conference. “And we know we have a long ways to go.” FEMA won’t reveal what municipalities it is working with “for privacy reasons,” but can report a total of nearly 200 applicants representing Vermont villages, towns, cities, counties, the state and private nonprofits. Many are covering flood costs with bank lines of credit as they fill out federal reimbursement forms that require intensely specific information, such as how many damaged trees were six or more inches in diameter “at breast height.” The answer to when they’ll receive money is just as involved. “Because of the different levels of complexity and the need to review for duplication of benefits,” FEMA said in a statement, “the timeline of reimbursement for each category of work will vary by weeks or months, contingent upon how readily FEMA receives information from each applicant to process the documentation.” But such bureaucracy isn’t the only speed bump. Shaw’s Supermarket in Ludlow, which reopened four months after Irene flooding, is one of many businesses taking a full year to return after the latest rain so as to add better storm barriers to curb future closures. “Most states take three to five years to recover from a disaster of this size,” said Farnham at the State Recovery Office. If history is any indication, such timelines can stretch even longer. Although the press declared the 1927 cleanup over upon the first anniversary, it continued for three more years, according to the book “The Troubled Roar of the Waters”: Vermont in Flood and Recovery, 1927-1931.” “The flood forced us to draw on our reserve energies, to unite in a spirit of brotherhood to help one another, to forget our differences of opinion for the time being and to plan together for the future,” the Burlington Free Press wrote in 1937. After Irene, many municipalities dripped in red ink for nearly a decade. Bethel, for example, didn’t stop reporting about its more than $8 million in bills until 2017. On the storm’s 10th anniversary in 2021, the state was finishing paperwork on 20 final projects. “Irene was just the appetizer for the main course that’s yet to come if we don’t buckle down and start making changes,” Neale Lunderville, the state’s first Irene recovery officer, said at the decade mark. Vermont officials have yet to announce specifics about this summer’s anniversary observance. But they view it simply as a reflective moment of pause in continuing rebuilding and reinforcing efforts. “Stopping and looking back and updating a year after will be good,” Farnham said. “But we still just need to keep pushing, especially with a short construction season. We need to make all the hay we can this summer.” Disclosure: Neale Lunderville is a member of the board of the Vermont Journalism Trust, the parent organization of VTDigger. ",

        "description": "Latex gloves, alcohol wipes and needles are common tools for administering injections — even when the shots are for trees.  On Tuesday, the Catamount Community Forest became a doctor’s office for a unique set of patients: ash trees that are at risk of being infested with invasive beetles called emerald ash borers. Experts from Arborjet — a company founded in 2000 that saves trees by injecting them with species-specific treatments — visited Williston to treat 11 ash trees with insecticide that will kill the beetles.  The emerald ash borer is an invasive species from Asia that has killed tens of millions of ash trees in North America over the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The beetles lay eggs in trees’ bark, and larvae burrow into and feed on inner layers of bark once they hatch, destroying the tree from the inside out.  When Terry Marron, a member of Williston’s conservation commission and Catamount Community Forest committee, learned that the beetles could be “devastating” to Vermont’s forests, she said she knew she had to do something to help. “My theory is: you gotta start somewhere,” Marron said. “You can’t stick your head in the sand and say it’s too far gone. There are always ways to take action.” In 2022, Marron worked with town officials and the Vermont Land Trust to get the ash trees their first round of injections. Today, the trees received a second dose through a grant from Arborjet, which should further safeguard them against the beetles.  Arborjet employees — protected with safety goggles and gloves — drill small holes every few inches near the base of the tree, inserting plastic plugs into each opening, said Kevin Brewer, the northeast territory manager for Arborjet. The drilling is not harmful to the trees as long as it’s done correctly, he said, and company staff even clean drill bits with isopropyl alcohol to ensure no diseases or infections are spread between trees.  Once the insect control formula is injected into an opening, Brewer said, the plug seals the injected treatment inside the tree where it can be distributed throughout the trunk and branches along with water and minerals taken up by the roots. After a few days, the formula — named Tree-age R10 after the medical term “triage” — will reach the bark where emerald ash borer larvae feed and the leaves where the adult beetles feed.  The insecticide used in this treatment “just goes after boring insects,” Brewer said. It isn’t absorbed into a tree’s nuts or fruits, keeping wildlife that eat those products safe, he added. The injections are different from other treatment methods, such as soil drenches that involve pouring insecticide on a tree’s roots, because the chemicals remain contained within the tree and can’t harm other plant and animal species through runoff, according to Brewer.  Just like shots that humans receive, Brewer said, a small injection can go a long way to help a tree become resistant to emerald ash borers. He said, on average, each tree receives about two milliliters of treatment per inch of trunk diameter, which is enough to protect the tree for two to three years.  The technology can work for trees that are already infested with beetles also, Brewer said, as long as no more than a third of the tree’s canopy has been destroyed. Once a tree has too many dead branches or cracks in its bark, it becomes harder to save.  Marron said the only downside to the technology is that “it’s not cheap.” The treatment for the 11 trees cost about $3,000, Brewer said, but it was all covered by Arborjet as part of its “Saving America’s Iconic Trees” initiative. One of the Williston trees — called “Big Jim” by locals — fits the bill of “iconic,” Brewer said, because it is one of the largest ash trees he’s seen in the state. The tree is named after former state Rep. Jim McCullough, who preserved the 393-acre plot that is now Catamount Community Forest with his family. Farther down the trail sits “Lovely Lucy,” an ash tree named after McCullough’s wife, who helped to build and maintain the forest’s network of trails.  The forest wouldn’t be recognizable without its ash trees, Marron said.  “They’re just so prominent in our landscape,” she said. “Without them, it would look like a whole part of the forest is missing.” According to the USDA, the emerald ash borer has been reported in 36 states since it was first found in the United States in 2002, and is largely concentrated in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. For many communities in New England, ash trees have “disappeared entirely,” Marron said.  And when ash trees go, “biodiversity goes with them,” Marron said. Ash trees provide habitat for birds and other wildlife species, food for caterpillars, strong bark for lichen to grow on, and late-falling leaves that improve soil quality — making them a “staple” for forest ecosystems, she said.  Protecting mature trees of any species is crucial to overall global climate health, according to the Arborjet website, because large trees sequester carbon, facilitate water infiltration into soil and support the biodiversity that Marron described.  Marron said the best thing locals can do to stop the spread of emerald ash borers is to not move firewood that could be infested from one place to another. Because once the beetles become prominent in an area, she said, options for ash trees’ future are limited.  Locals can choose to leave trees standing after they begin to die from infestation — dead trees are still crucial parts of forest ecosystems, according to a 2019 report from The Wildlife Society, because they provide habitat for many animal species. And, Marron said, some trees are naturally resistant to the bugs, so it’s important to give them the chance to fight before hastily cutting them down.  But she said leaving dying trees untouched can be dangerous in areas with public trails such as Catamount Community Forest. Once trees are infested, branches become brittle and often fall off, which could harm hikers. So, she said her only two options are to treat ash trees before they become heavily infested or cut them down if it’s too late.  Marron said she’ll continue to advocate for preventative measures so that the latter call never has to be made in the “Big Jim Grove” — which she calls the “core group” of ash trees in the Catamount Community Forest.  “The goal is that, when people walk these trails 50 years from now, all the trees will still be here,” Marron said. “And the real hope is that there will be some new trees, too.” Clarification: This story was updated to more accurately describe the options for dealing with ash trees infested with emerald ash borers.

        "description": "Cleanup efforts are still underway after 800 gallons of chemical fire-fighting foam spilled at the Vermont National Guard’s aviation facility in South Burlington.  The building’s fire suppression system experienced a mechanical failure late Thursday night and began releasing the foam. By Friday morning, the foam had leaked into the facility’s drainage system and spread to South Burlington’s wastewater treatment plant.  Concern regarding the severity of the spill rose over the weekend as locals found “no swimming” signs posted along the Winooski River — the river that the South Burlington plant releases treated water into — and Lake Champlain near the mouth of the river. The Vermont Department of Health asked parks in South Burlington, Winooski, Burlington, Colchester and the Winooski Valley Parks District to close their public swimming areas on Friday afternoon, said Sharon Muellers, the department’s senior public health communication officer. Matt Chapman, director of the waste management and prevention division within Vermont’s Department of Environmental Conservation, said the “no swimming” signs were initially posted “out of an abundance of caution” but will be taken down today now that experts know more about the situation.  The substance that spilled, aqueous film-forming foam, contains a group of synthetic chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Exposure to these chemicals, commonly known as PFAS, can lead to health problems including developmental defects, cancer, liver problems and decreased immune response.  “We’re actively engaged in responding to the release (of the foam), and I think the public can feel safe about the conditions in the Winooski River,” Chapman said. “But we’re getting data to confirm that right now.” Chapman said his team’s assessment comes in part from a better understanding of how much of the foam was released into the environment. About 650 gallons were contained inside the aviation facility and only 150 gallons were released into the South Burlington wastewater treatment system, he said. Foam was cleared from the treatment plant on Friday, Chapman said, and there was no “visual evidence” of foam being discharged from the plant into the Winooski River. But “there may be small amounts of dissolved PFAS” that were released, he said. The only way to know is to wait for the results of water quality tests — which won’t be available until later this week, he said.  While the treatment plant itself has already been cleaned, Chapman said, the next step is to clean out the piping of the airport’s wastewater infrastructure to ensure that no more PFAS are tracked into the plant.  Maj. Mikel Arcovitch, the Vermont National Guard’s state public affairs officer, said in an interview that the 650 gallons of foam contained within the Army Aviation Support Facility were removed on Friday by Republic Services, a recycling and waste solutions company based in Williston.  Now, Arcovitch said, Vermont National Guard officials must decontaminate anything that came into contact with the foam, including at least one helicopter. The building will reopen Wednesday, and an investigation of the fire-fighting system that malfunctioned will start Thursday, he said. The foam system hasn’t been in active use for fire suppression at the facility for about 10 years, Arcovitch said.  “It’s been kind of just sitting in a container, and we’ve been sitting on it, waiting for it to be removed,” he said. According to the Department of Environmental Conservation’s 2023 PFAS Roadmap, another National Guard facility — the Air National Guard Facility, also located at the Burlington International Airport — has needed “ongoing remediation” for PFAS contamination to nearby soils and groundwater due to use of the firefighting foam. Chapman said that while Vermont has some PFAS regulations in place — including Act 36, which bans PFAS chemicals from being used in fire-fighting foam — they don’t always apply to locations like the aviation facility that are also monitored by the U.S. Department of Defense and Federal Aviation Administration.  The lack of consistency, he said, is a “historic issue” that has long-term implications.  Because PFAS are very stable chemicals — they’re often called “forever chemicals” — they do not break down and can build up in the environment, wildlife and humans over time, according to the Department of Environmental Conservation’s reports on PFAS. The chemicals are also water soluble and mobile, meaning they can travel in water far from where they were initially released, making many drinking water sources vulnerable to contamination. Chapman said his team will continue to test the Winooski River and land around the airport and wastewater treatment plant in the coming weeks to monitor PFAS levels. But, he said locals shouldn’t be concerned about drinking water at this time: the Winooski River runs at 5,000 gallons per second, he said, making any contamination from the spill “a very small amount” in comparison. The Department of Environmental Conservation and the Vermont National Guard are expected to release additional updates about cleanup progress and PFAS investigations as more information becomes available.  Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated which National Guard facility needed ongoing remediation for PFAS contamination.

        "description": "Hundreds of gallons of chemical foam used to fight fires have spilled out of the Army Aviation Support Facility and into the South Burlington wastewater treatment system, according to Vermont National Guard officials. Col. Jacob Roy of the Vermont National Guard said work is underway to contain the spill and remove the foam from all affected areas.  “To our knowledge, it has not made it into any other water system,” he said in an interview. “So we will work directly with (the South Burlington water treatment plant) to ensure that we get everything cleaned up to satisfactory standards.” The spill began around 9 or 10 p.m. Thursday, Roy said, when the building’s fire suppression system was set off by a mechanical failure. There is “no indication of a fire or any hazards that triggered it,” he said. The 800 gallons of foam first spread through the building — located at the north end of the Burlington International Airport — and later moved through the building’s drainage system to the wastewater treatment plant, Roy said.   No one was at the aviation facility — which includes a hangar, aircraft maintenance areas, and administrative and classroom spaces — at the time of the spill, Roy said. It is unclear how much damage was done to the facility, he said, and a full investigation won’t be possible until the foam is removed.  The substance that was spilled, aqueous film-forming foam, is used to fight high-hazard flammable liquid fires. It is often found in areas where significant amounts of flammable liquids are regularly used, such as aircraft hangars, according to a report from the Interstate Technology and Regulatory Council.  The foam contains a group of synthetic chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. These chemicals, commonly known as PFAS, can have cancerous health effects on humans and wildlife, according to the report.  Foam spills can be more damaging to the environment than other chemical spills, according to the report, because PFAS cannot be removed from water using conventional wastewater treatment processes.  Robert Fischer, the water quality superintendent for South Burlington, said the spill won’t harm the wastewater treatment facility on Airport Parkway because staff have already stopped contaminated water from entering the parts of the system it could damage. The facility’s chemist has already tested water samples, Fischer said, and “everything is looking fine.” “I don’t believe it’ll have much impact on the facility, or on the aquatic macroinvertebrates or fish in the river,” he said. “But it is a cancer causing agent, and it’s been released into the environment, so we can’t take this lightly.”  Fischer said he found out about the spill around 8 a.m. Friday when his staff noticed foam coming into the facility. Around the same time, he said, officials from the Vermont National Guard began to contain the spill and reported it to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The National Guard contracted Republic Services, a recycling and waste solutions company based in Williston, to lead the clean up, Fischer said. The company is using vactor trucks — or what Fisher describes as a “wet dry vac on wheels” — to vacuum up the foam and transport it to a toxic disposal area.  “(Republic Services officials) are actively retrieving the spill as best they can,” Fischer said. “And I made some operational changes here to compensate for everything. And that’s all we can do.” Roy said the Vermont National Guard will release updates as more information about the progress of the clean up becomes available.  ",

Calm, warm water creates the ideal conditions for cyanobacteria to grow, according to the Lake Champlain Basin Program. The Department of Health’s cyanobacteria tracker currently shows no locations under high alert for such blooms. However, four areas on Lake Champlain have reported low levels of cyanobacteria, according to the tracker: the northern shore of Malletts Bay and Brown Ledge Camp in Colchester, and the marina and Texaco Beach in Burlington. Texaco Beach is currently closed for swimming due to the high cyanobacteria levels, according to Burlington’s Department of Parks, Recreation and Waterfront. Staff members are testing water quality three to four times daily and will close other beaches as necessary. Cyanobacteria blooms are green or blue-green in color and can look like paint splatters on the water’s surface. Toxins produced by the bacteria can be harmful to humans and animals, causing rashes, stomach problems and other health concerns.  The blooms can be especially dangerous to children and pets, who may accidently swallow water while playing in it, according to the Department of Health. Cyanobacteria blooms also pose a threat to freshwater ecosystems as a whole, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Blooms harm water quality, food resources and habitats for aquatic species, and they reduce oxygen levels in the water which can lead to illness and death in fish populations. As cyanobacteria is tracked in Vermont year after year, locals are noticing that blooms are appearing both earlier and later in the summer season.  Alec Kaeding, Burlington’s waterfront and parks operations manager, said June would have been considered “unusually early” to see a cyanobacteria bloom a few years ago, but he wasn’t surprised to see the bloom at Texaco Beach this month. “From my observations, we’re seeing these earlier and earlier every year,” he said. “I think it’s the norm now.” In its 2018 State of the Lake study, the Lake Champlain Basin Program reported that blooms were concentrated in July and August. By 2021, the annual report showed that blooms were becoming common in the early fall as well.  “Unfortunately, climate change may increase these periods of warm and calm conditions to make increasingly favorable conditions for blooms in the future,” noted the 2021 report.  ",

        "description": "Fletcher Free Library director Mary Danko stood outside the library Tuesday morning and welcomed patrons looking to cool off during the 90-degree heat. “Are those popsicles?” she stopped to ask a delivery worker bringing several boxes inside. Danko and her fellow library employees groaned when he informed them it was printer ink. Fletcher Free Library is one of six air-conditioned, open-to-all cooling centers open in Burlington during this week’s heat wave, though it was closed on Wednesday in observance of Juneteenth. Danko said she thought it was the ideal place to cool off, and was glad to see many residents agreed. “On a hot day like this,” Danko said, “isn’t that the best way to spend the day — inside with a good book?” Wednesday marked the second of three consecutive heat advisory days covering all of Vermont, with some areas seeing heat indexes above 100 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Across the state, residents and organizations have adjusted their routines to help themselves and their communities to stay cool until Friday, when the heat wave is expected to pass. Though Tuesday’s temperatures were a touch lower than forecasted, NWS Burlington meteorologist Jessica Storm said the humidity pushed heat indices into the range for a heat advisory. She expected it to heat up further on Wednesday and then cool off a bit Thursday. “Today will be kind of our peak,” Storm said on Wednesday morning, adding that NWS has forecasted heat indices in the high 90s and low 100s throughout the state. The Champlain and Connecticut River valleys have seen the hottest temperatures so far, which Storm explained often happens in lower elevation, wide valley areas where heat can pool and linger longer than in higher, hilly areas. She also noted that parts of the region may see severe thunderstorms Wednesday as a dissipating storm system moves eastward from northern New York. Storm said that to stay safe, Vermonters should look to limit outdoor time, wear light colored clothes and check in on their neighbors. She noted that if your house does not have air conditioning, it may continue to get warmer inside even as the weather outside starts to cool off. Not everyone has the ability to limit outdoor time, however — people experiencing homelessness and those who work outdoors are more vulnerable than most during heat waves. Amy Lawrence, who works for Another Way, a Montpelier non-profit that offers daytime shelter for those experiencing homelessness, said Wednesday that it had been a bit busier than usual that morning. She said that the community center would not be open Thursday, as it will be conducting staff training. But she has put up fliers around the center, including on the front door, informing people about the nearest cooling centers — such as the library, the transit center and the City Hall council chambers. Montpelier and many other municipalities across the state have been offering cooling centers, air conditioned spaces that are free and open to all, as a resource to beat the heat. Hartford officials posted a list of the town’s options on Facebook, including libraries, the Sherman Manning Aquatic Facility and the Bugbee Senior Center. The senior center had planned to close Wednesday in observance of Juneteenth, but executive director Mark Bradley said the heat prompted them to change those plans. “We noticed that pretty much every other public facility was going to close,” Bradley said. “It just felt important to at least have someplace for people to go and cool off if they needed to.” He added that they put out a call for volunteers to staff the center, not wanting to cancel the holiday for their employees, and received more sign-ups than they had shifts for. People have also been bringing water and other goods to donate. “It’s nice to see that so many people are ready to help out,” Bradley said Elsewhere, some people have been using more creative means to stay cool.In Burlington’s City Hall Park on Tuesday, the splash fountain was used to its fullest extent for most of the morning. Children delighted in running through the jets, while at least one adult used them to meditate. Around 10:30 a.m., Milton resident Ben Miller carefully studied the pattern of the fountain before sitting cross-legged directly behind one of the geysers, closing his eyes, and allowing the water to come crashing down on his head and back. He said he’d come to Burlington to buy some new sandals, but arrived before the shop opened, so he “came to say hi to the fountain.” “This is the best place to refresh yourself,” Miller said. “It’s like the ancient Greek baths.” Miller advised everyone nearby to join him in the fountains, but at the time he and a family with a small child were the only partakers.  “Kids don’t need a reminder” to indulge in a refreshing splash-about, he said. “They know instinctively.” In Bennington, the fire department set up a “Beat the Heat” event behind the firehouse and sprayed sweltering residents with a hose mounted atop a fire truck’s ladder. Fire Chief Nathan Berres said the event was a no-brainer given the Tuesday afternoon heat. He estimated around 30 people came to cool off Tuesday, and the department planned more sessions for Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. “This is a fantastic way to get out in the community and keep people cool that might not otherwise have the means to,” Berres said. “It gets the kids around the trucks, and helps to ease their minds. Which is really what the fire department’s here for.” ",

        "article_link": "https://vtdigger.org/2024/06/18/flood-debris-causes-air-quality-problems-at-coventry-landfill/",
        "description": "In the aftermath of last summer’s devastating floods, Casella, the company that owns Vermont’s only operating landfill, accepted debris from demolished buildings, including a large amount of drywall and plaster.  According to Casella, that material has produced sulfur dioxide emissions that exceed the Coventry landfill’s air quality standards outlined in its state permit. While the pollutants surpassed the facility’s permitted limit in March, April and May, according to the state Agency of Natural Resources, Casella said the emissions have stayed within federal standards and do not immediately pose a significant risk to the public. The company is working to install a permanent treatment system that is designed to reduce the emissions.  Sulfur dioxide, a pollutant that is also commonly emitted during the burning of fossil fuels, can cause respiratory problems. People with existing respiratory conditions such as asthma, especially children, are most vulnerable, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency.  Drywall and plaster are mostly composed of calcium sulfate and “made up a significant portion of the tens of thousands of tons of waste” that the landfill accepted after the flood, according to a recent press release issued by Casella. Once in the landfill, the material changes the composition of the gases that the landfill typically creates, producing hydrogen sulfide, which can result in elevated levels of sulfur dioxide.   The gases created by the landfill are pulled into a collection system and combusted to create energy for Washington Electric Cooperative. That combustion process is where the sulfur dioxide enters the atmosphere, according to Jeff Weld, a spokesperson for Casella.  At high concentrations, sulfur dioxide and other similar compounds can cause environmental harm, such as damaging the foliage of trees and plants and stunting their growth, according to the EPA. The state standard for the landfill’s sulfur dioxide emissions is 40 tons per year — much stricter than the federal standard, which is 250 tons per year, according to Weld. The federal standard “provides public health protection,” Jay Hollingsworth, who supervises the permitting and engineering section of the Agency of Natural Resources’ Air Quality & Climate Division, told VTDigger in an email.  The Coventry landfill has not exceeded those federal standards for sulfur dioxide, according to Weld.  “I wouldn’t call it a cause for major concern, but it is a cause for awareness of why it’s important to have a strong approach in terms of collecting the material, sequestering it and really understanding what that makeup is,” Weld said.  Casella measures the levels of hydrogen sulfide on a monthly basis using detection tubes. Then, they estimate sulfur dioxide levels based on the hydrogen sulfide concentrations. While Casella works to implement its new treatment system, it is using an activated carbon system designed to reduce hydrogen sulfide levels in the gas stream, thereby lowering the sulfur dioxide levels, Weld said.  The measures Casella has taken have “begun reducing the associated sulfur dioxide emissions,” according to Hollingsworth.  According to Weld, the measures “have resulted in a sitewide month over month reduction of (hydrogen sulfide) by nearly half.” Prior flood events have shown the Agency of Natural Resources and the Environmental Protection Agency that peak hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide emissions could materialize more than a year after the flood, according to Casella. Officials saw the same pattern at the Moretown Landfill after Hurricane Irene.  With that knowledge, Weld said staff members at Casella proactively met with state and federal agencies in September to develop a plan.  Weld said the company decided to issue a press release to “educate the public without alarm.”  “To us, it was important to be out in front and say, ‘Hey, we’re working on this with ANR. We understand why it’s occurring,’” Weld said.  Climate change continues to cause natural disasters that result in more debris, a factor that Weld said should be considered in long-term planning.  “It’s one of those things that we see with events like this,” he said. “As they become more likely to happen, now and in the future, it’s got to be part of how we permit these facilities, how we think about installing new equipment to treat for that sort of thing.” ",

Not all of these sites are free, and not all of them are open to the public at all hours. You can use the map above to check the operating hours and whether the site has a fee, but the best way to be sure is to call the location or check out its website.  If you do have to stay outside or in an uncooled building, the health department recommends that you stay hydrated, wear lightweight clothing and avoid exertion.

        "description": "Members of both the House and Senate voted on Monday to override Gov. Phil Scott’s veto of a bill that aims to increase Vermont’s reliance on renewable energy. It requires most of the state’s utilities to purchase 100% of their electricity by 2030.  Each chamber needed a two-thirds majority to override Scott’s veto. House members voted 102-43 to override the bill, and senators voted 21-8.  The debate surrounding H.289 has focused on its estimated cost to ratepayers. Scott’s administration contended the bill would be expensive for Vermonters, adding to a number of increased living costs in the state. “Factoring in all the other taxes, fees and higher costs the Legislature has passed over the last two years, I simply cannot allow this bill to go into law,” he wrote in a letter to lawmakers explaining his veto last month.  The bill’s supporters and the state’s Joint Fiscal Office, meanwhile, have said that the Scott administration’s projections were inflated.  Supporters of the renewable energy standard often credit the existing law with shifting the state’s electric portfolio to mostly renewable energy. The previous law required utilities to buy 75% of their energy from renewable sources by 2032. H.289 accelerates that transition, requiring most utilities to source 100% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Under its provisions, all utilities must make the switch by 2035.  The law also requires utilities over time to purchase about 20% of their energy from in-state renewable sources and an additional 20% from renewable sources in the region that are capable of sending power directly into the New England grid.  Utilities can purchase renewable energy credits from solar, wind and hydro projects, but they don’t have control over most of the sources that power New England’s grid, including a large percentage that comes from natural gas.  Supporters of H.289 say that the new law creates a greater opportunity for Vermont utilities to cut carbon pollution in the region. By requiring utilities to purchase more power from new renewable sources in New England — and therefore fund those projects — the utilities could potentially displace natural gas plants.  The framework for the bill came from a rare consensus among utilities, industry representatives and environmental groups. The Scott administration presented a different proposal it said would be cheaper to implement.  “Vermont currently has the lowest electricity rates in New England and this will support our work to increase the reliability of our electric grid while also ensuring we are doing so with clean energy,” House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, said in a statement following her chamber’s successful override vote.  “Our state is incredibly reliant on the climate, from farming to skiing to maple syrup, and we need to do all we can to help lower our reliance on fossil fuels and set us up for success for years to come,” Krowinski said.  After senators followed suit, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, issued a statement calling the governor’s veto the continuation of “a pattern of rejecting critical progress on climate action.” “However, while Vermonters continue to face the impacts of recent climate disasters, the Senate has made clear that the status quo is unacceptable and will continue our unwavering commitment to addressing the climate crisis,” he said.  A group of environmental groups — including 350VT, Vermont Conservation Voters, Vermont Natural Resources Council, Vermont Public Interest Research Group, the Conservation Law Foundation of Vermont, Vermont Sierra Club and the trade group Renewable Energy Vermont — applauded the override. In a statement, they called the bill’s passage “the most significant action Vermont has ever taken to cut carbon pollution in the electric sector.” ",

        "description": "This story by Jenny Blair was first published by the Montpelier Bridge on June 11. Montpelier’s street trees often live short lives. Roots hit impenetrable compacted soils once they outgrow their planted space, often a meager 4-foot-by-4-foot square. But now, new trees taking root under downtown sidewalks should grow tall and survive to old age, thanks to a new planting method that lets them thrive in tough urban environments.  This month, the Montpelier Parks Department plans to plant two saplings on Main Street in front of Walgreens and the American Legion. Workers will prepare beds under the sidewalk using the Stockholm tree pit method, which balances the need for structural support with the trees’ needs for airy, spacious, and nutrient-rich soils.  “What we’re trying to do is basically grow a goldfish inside a shot glass,” said Parks and Trees Director Alec Ellsworth of the city’s longtime approach to tree planting. “We were replacing trees every five to seven years,” added John Snell, chair of the Tree Board. Several years ago Montpelier tree officials decided to try an innovative approach. Developed in Stockholm, Sweden, the method involves digging out a generous pit, or tree well, along 500 square feet of sidewalk, then filling it with 3- to 5-inch-diameter stones that can support compression from above.  Spaces between the stones are then filled with a mix of compost and biochar, a carbon-rich, charcoal-like substance, allowing space for roots to grow and find nutrients and air.  On top of that, a thinner layer of small stones will provide what Ellsworth explains is a natural air barrier, one that prevents roots spreading up into overlying pavement while still letting air into the pit.  Called structural soil, the pit materials bear the weight of sidewalks while giving roots space to grow and plenty of air, water, and nutrients. Nearby, small circular grates also direct water toward the root zone rather than into storm drains, reducing rainfall runoff. (The tree wells will not prevent extreme flooding, however.) Four young trees were planted downtown in 2021 using the Stockholm method, including an American elm in front of Mad Taco and another in front of Yankee Wine and Spirits.  The new trees — which also include a Freeman maple and two honey locusts — are thriving. Last summer, the one near Mad Taco grew by as much as 47 inches, Ellsworth estimated. Snell said this year’s new trees will likely be a Princeton elm and a white oak.  Each tree costs about $10,000, according to Ellsworth. Of that, approximately $7,000 pays for the cast-iron grate and cylindrical tree guard — the prices for which have approximately quadrupled since 2019, Snell and Ellsworth estimated. But what the city is paying for amounts to much more than a leafier, more aesthetically pleasing streetscape. Trees are crucial tools for climate adaptation, beginning with their ability to improve stormwater management. Large trees also cool cities thanks to shade and the release of water vapor during photosynthesis, which in turn can reduce air conditioning costs in addition to creating more pleasant outdoor conditions. Using a thermal imaging gun on a hot day, Ellsworth said, “the pavement might be 110 degrees. The air might be 85 degrees. And then you point at a bench in the shade [and it] might be 72 degrees.”  Urban trees also improve air quality by filtering out fine particulate matter, such as the Canadian wildfire smoke that fouled Vermont last summer. The strongest effects on air quality and temperature occur within 100 meters of the tree, according to the Nature Conservancy’s Planting Healthy Air report. Snell also points out the economic benefits.  “There’s a direct connection in studies between having greenery in downtowns and how much money people spend in stores,” Snell said. Research by the U.S. Forest Service has found that shoppers are willing to spend more time and pay more for products and services in business districts lined with trees. That includes paying more to park in the shade.  City officials aim to plant many more street trees with the Stockholm method, not only because the traditional method often dooms young trees, but also because many of Montpelier’s older street trees are expected to die as well. As the emerald ash borer beetle advances, Ellsworth said, the city’s large downtown ash trees, like the one in front of Bethany Church, will succumb.  “We’re treating them to keep them alive as long as we can, but we know that they’re not going to survive,” he said. East State Street is among the sites being eyed for a future planting project, according to Snell.  “We’d love to have that whole row of trees, which is right along the first block, end up being one long bed underground,” he said.  Funding streams for the plantings have mostly come from tree organizations, but demonstrating success might open up new sources of support, Ellsworth said.  “There’s way more funding in stormwater, downtown improvement, and that kind of thing,” he said. “If we can tap into different funding streams because we’re providing multiple benefits, then it will really help us pull this off in a more comprehensive way.”  ",

        "description": "This story by Aaron Calvin was first published by the News & Citizen on June 13. Should the herbicide ProcellaCOR be deployed to fight the milfoil infestation in Lake Eden? That was the question in the Eden Central School gymnasium on Saturday as a crowd of lake residents and others gathered to ask four experts questions about the weed’s effect on Eden’s premier recreation site. A panel organized by the Lake Eden Association brought together experts on the substance, application and permitting of the herbicide. They extolled its upsides and outlined potential safety risks while soliciting the public’s questions. In the summer of 2022, the association discovered the presence of milfoil, a tenaciously invasive aquatic plant in Lake Eden. They sounded the alarm ahead of Town Meeting Day the next year about the seriousness of the issue and the importance of an early response. Left on its own, milfoil quickly grows across the surface of a waterbody while it chokes out other vegetation and provides no shelter or nutrients for local aquatic life. Association members called the lake the “economic heart of Eden” and said lakeside housing generated 21% of the town’s property tax revenue. The town approved spending $15,000 in both 2023 and 2024 to pull the milfoil by hand, employ vegetation-suffocating blankets and use divers to vacuum it up, with a lot of help from volunteers. The lake’s robust greeter program also monitors boat traffic in and out of the lake and ensures milfoil isn’t slipping through on vessels. Still, milfoil, a plant that fragments into small pieces that can easily take root and grow quickly, has remained difficult to bring under control. “Despite these very aggressive efforts to eradicate this milfoil, using all available non-herbicide methods, we find that we are just slowing the process,” said Colleen Brennan, a lake association member who moderated the event. Now the dedicated volunteers on the lake association are investigating whether to deploy ProcellaCOR — an herbicide that specifically attacks milfoil and is the only one legally permitted by the state — in shallow, difficult to treat areas of the lake. The assembled panel included Pat Suozzi, president of the Federation of Vermont Lakes and Ponds; Michael Lew-Smith, a botanist and partner at Arrowwood Environmental retained to study the milfoil problem on Lake Eden; Brendan McCarthy, a consultant at a lake management company with experience applying the herbicide; and Olin Reed, an aquatic biologist with the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation with local roots in the Eden area. Each one was of one mind about the use of the relatively new ProcellaCOR: The herbicide is effective, has a minimal impact on the water and surrounding ecosystem and, though available data is limited, doesn’t appear to have any long-term consequences. Suozzi attested to its effective use in combating milfoil epidemics on Lake Iroquois in Hinesburg and in Addison County’s Lake Dunmore. She also argued that use of the herbicide was more cost-effective than treatment without it, and reduced pressure on volunteer efforts to manage milfoil, though other mitigation efforts would still be required, and warned that “misinformation” spread about the herbicide threatened effective action. In their discussions of the use of ProcellaCOR, Suozzi, Lew-Smith and McCarthy all talked about how any browning or adverse effects caused to other lake vegetation by the herbicide seemed to be temporary, and they said that the chemical treatment had no long-term effect on animal life or water quality. Lew-Smith, in particular, said that while he “hadn’t seen enough data to know everything about” the herbicide, its effect seemed limited from what he’d observed. ProcellaCOR was first registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2018. It’s currently the only “actively permitted herbicide in Vermont,” according to information presented by Reed, and has been used 25 times since 2019 and in small areas of 11 lakes across the state. McCarthy discussed the success his company has had applying it in New Hampshire and Vermont, and though he reiterated that it’s too new of a chemical to gauge long-term effects, he mostly focused on its efficacy. Reed explained Vermont’s stringent rules for the application of herbicides in any body of water, which only allow it if there’s no non-chemical alternative available, an acceptable level of risk to the environment, a clear public benefit and a long-term management plan is developed. Other divisions within the Agency of Natural Resources weigh in on the application process, which includes a public notice period before a final permit is issued. An internal 2022 memo published by an Agency of Natural Resources environmental scientist said that, according to its analysis of ProcellaCOR, “the potential for acute and chronic risks to fish, aquatic invertebrates, amphibians and other aquatic animals is considered low.” But this April, the state permanently denied a permit to apply ProcellaCOR in Lake Bomoseen after a “great deal of public opposition” and united opposition on the town’s selectboard, according to the Rutland Herald. Cynthia Moulton, a Vermont State University-Castleton professor of toxicology and ecology who formerly worked for the EPA’s pesticides division, published an editorial when the permit was first filed in 2022 claiming that ProcellaCOR “posed unacceptable risk and adverse effects to the nontarget organisms” and that “significant ecological risks alone should be enough to legally negate the permit request.” The decision was appealed in May to the Vermont Superior Court Environmental Division, not by its original applicant, the Lake Bomoseen Association, but by an environmental engineer in Fairhaven who wanted to ensure the herbicides could continue to be used to battle invasive species in Vermont. ProcellaCOR will be applied in Lake George in New York, but only after a May appellate court undid a New York Supreme Court decision that found the state had violated regulations regarding holding public processes when approving the permit. The Lake George Association issued a scathing rebuke of the Lake George Park Commission, arguing the “risks of ProcellaCOR are too great to experiment with it in Lake George.” During a question-and-answer period of the meeting, one Eden resident expressed concern about ProcellaCOR’s own admission of its environmental risks on its label. But Suozzi said that such a small amount of the herbicide is used that its effect on plants and animals will be entirely non-lethal. Among anxiety about the potential risks of such a new herbicide was concern about what would happen to the lake if the milfoil wasn’t brought under control. Suozzi presented before and after images to demonstrate ProcellaCOR’s efficacy — a sickly green surface covered in milfoil paired with another showing nothing but clear blue water. There was also the matter of eventual burnout among those currently devoting their time to fighting the milfoil battle without chemicals. Correction: This story was updated to clarify the action taken by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on ProcellaCOR in 2018. ",

        "description": "This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.  The town of Berlin has taken legal action against the owner of a manufactured home park hit by catastrophic flooding last summer, asking a judge to halt construction currently underway at the property.  In a complaint filed in state environmental court on June 11, the town alleges that redevelopment work at the Berlin Mobile Home Park, which sits alongside the Stevens Branch of the Winooski River, flouts the town’s rules for building in a floodplain. The unpermitted work could both endanger the lives of future park residents, the town argues, and jeopardize flood insurance eligibility for people living in Berlin. Dozens of residents were displaced from the park after floodwaters ripped through last July. The site has remained uninhabited since then, but redevelopment work has recently begun. The town included photos of a new concrete pad getting poured near the entrance of the park on June 6 with its complaint. Earlier this week, Ture Nelson, the acting town administrator, declined to confirm with VTDigger/Vermont Public whether he had been speaking with state officials about taking legal action against the park owner. But he noted that he had witnessed construction at the park that seemed to fly in the face of the town’s zoning. “I have observed work at the park that I don’t feel is in compliance with floodway regulations,” Nelson said on Wednesday. The owner of the company that runs the park, Randy Rouleau, has not responded to repeated interview requests. The town is asking the court to stop further construction at the property before a hearing takes place, and to prohibit future construction of new manufactured homes and other related infrastructure in the “regulated floodway.” It is also calling for the removal of “all new structures already illegally built on the property,” and is seeking damages resulting from the park owner’s violations of the town’s zoning rules. An initial hearing in the case has been scheduled for June 21. ",

        "description": "A warm, humid air mass from the Gulf of Mexico is moving north across the country — and is aimed squarely at Vermont, according to Eric Myskowski, a meteorologist from the Burlington branch of the National Weather Service.   Starting Tuesday, maximum temperatures are expected to surpass 90 degrees in most of the state, according to the NWS, with rising humidity making temperatures feel even warmer.  “We expect temperatures to stay close to 70 at night,” said Myskowski, explaining that high humidity limits the air’s cooling after sundown.  Such high heat is uncommon, but not unheard of, in Vermont in mid-June. If temperatures remain at 95 degrees or higher for two consecutive hours in a given region, the NWS will issue a heat advisory — a criteria which Myskowski expects will be met in a few places. “It will be likely that we do (issue a heat advisory) in the Champlain Valley during this time,” said Myskowski.  Unlike earlier in the year, however, valley residents looking to cool off in Lake Champlain need not fear hypothermia from icy waters. The lake’s temperature currently sits at a safe 67 degrees, according to data from the United States Geological Survey.  Residents of the Connecticut River Valley are expected to experience the highest temperatures of anywhere in the state. Towns like Springfield and Bradford along the river are both forecast to hit 96 degrees on Wednesday. During periods of extreme heat, Myskowski recommends limiting strenuous activity, staying hydrated and keeping the house cool by opening windows and turning on fans. According to U.S Energy Department survey data, about one third of Vermont households do not use any air conditioning equipment.  “You really want to be limiting time outside,” said Myskowski.  Not all Vermonters have access to somewhere cool and away from the sun, however. People experiencing homelessness, by nature of their living situation, often spend most of their day outdoors.  “The heat — there’s really no way around it,” Steve Kozikowski said on Thursday morning. He was sitting in the front room of Another Way, a Montpelier nonprofit that provides a daytime sanctuary, including food, water and showers, for unhoused people. Kozikowski, 43, described himself as homeless on-and-off since he was 16. He is currently camping in East Montpelier, a 3.5-mile walk from Another Way. Without his recently acquired bicycle, he said, his hygiene would have been the first thing to suffer with the rising heat.  “It’s too hot to be walking one hour and fifteen minutes just to take a shower and turn around again,” said Kozikowski.  But the immediate worry for people who are living on the street, according to Kozikowski, is access to drinkable water. When temperatures rise, dehydration can set in quickly and make it difficult to move — which Kozikowski said makes people desperate enough to fill up water bottles from rivers and creeks.  Untreated water from the state’s rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds is not safe to drink, according to Vermont’s Department of Health. Floods further raise the possibility of water contamination.  “If you’re drinking the water with no filtration system, you’re playing Russian roulette,” said Kozikowski. ",

        "description": "Officials from the Vermont Department of Fish & Wildlife are warning that a viral video showing two black bears in a Waitsfield backyard — one of which appears to be relaxing on a hammock — isn’t as cute as it looks.  Instead, it’s an example of increasingly common human-bear encounters in Vermont, which can turn dangerous for both bears and people. In May, a game warden euthanized a bear in Underhill after it repeatedly displayed aggressive behavior toward a person.  Noah Dweck, the videographer and homeowner, told VTDigger that he was sitting in his home office on Tuesday when he heard the chains of his hammock jingling in the backyard, and he knew immediately that it was “the bears.”  With his home situated in a mountainous section of the Mad River Valley, Dweck and his wife, Kristen, are aware that they live in bear country. They have taken a number of measures to keep bears away — a piece of context viewers wouldn’t know from the video, which the Associated Press published on Wednesday. Bears have tried to get into their dumpsters, which are secured with bear bars, Dweck said, and they’ve climbed into their truck bed. Dweck said the couple keeps the garbage and recycling secure, does not use bird feeders, and takes care not to leave food in cars or outdoor areas.  “We definitely make sure that we don’t have anything that’s attracting them,” he said. “They’re just around.” David Sausville, who leads the department’s wildlife restoration management and research section, said he was particularly concerned to see the Waitsfield bears’ apparent lack of fear when Dweck approached them and yelled at them to leave. Dweck said he was concerned by this behavior, too.  “I came out, and was like, ‘Hey!’ and they just kind of stared at me, which is what they like to do, because they’re so used to us,” he said.  After catching a video of the bear swinging in the hammock, Dweck said he used an air horn, which he keeps handy, to scare the bears away.  Sausville said the Fish & Wildlife Department has logged more than 400 human-bear encounters already this year, and he expects this year’s number to exceed last year’s 880 recorded encounters.  Department officials recently told VTDigger that, up until 2016, members of the department anticipated roughly 130 reports of bear encounters each year. In 2020, there were 1,700 reports, and in 2022, there were 1,400.  “There’s a lot of cubs that have been brought up, through the years, with these females that know where the food is, and now they’re out on their own,” Sausville said. “So we’ve got a whole generation of bears that have learned, ‘humans mean food,’ and that’s not a good situation.” Sausville said bears are commonly attracted most by garbage and recycling left unsecured, bird feeders left up in the summer, grills and food residue outside and compost that isn’t handled properly and creates smells.  Although seeing a bear can be exciting, scaring the bear away and making it uncomfortable near humans will help to keep the animal safer, he said. He recommends using an air horn, yelling or banging pots and pans to scare the animals.  “There have been cases out west where they’ve shown, when those communities come together, everybody — the homeowners, the restaurants with their dumpsters, the trash haulers — they’ve actually reduced substantially the number of bear incidents,” he said.  Most of that success comes from small behavioral changes on the part of humans, he said.  People can report bear encounters and learn more about preventing bear-human encounters at the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department’s website.

        "description": "This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public. Construction activity at a manufactured home park in Berlin that flooded catastrophically last summer is raising alarm bells among state and town officials, who have hinted at possible legal action to stop the work. The Berlin Mobile Home Park is located on a narrow stretch of land off the Barre-Montpelier Road, right alongside the Stevens Branch of the Winooski River.  After floodwaters swept through the park last July, dozens of residents were displaced.  Since then, the park has sat uninhabited, with numerous flooded-out homes still onsite as of earlier this week. On Tuesday, a construction crew could be seen rehabilitating a home at the back of the park. Closer to the entrance, a new concrete pad appeared to have been recently poured. Several new-looking manufactured home units were staged in a nearby parking lot. Officials are concerned about the construction. “I have observed work at the park that I don’t feel is in compliance with floodway regulations,” said Ture Nelson, acting town administrator for Berlin, via phone on Wednesday. Last August, several weeks after the flooding, Nelson sent a letter to the park’s owner, Randy Rouleau, outlining the steps Rouleau would need to take in order to redevelop the Berlin Mobile Home Park and another, smaller park his company owns nearby called River Run. Nearly all the land in the 32-unit Berlin Mobile Home Park sits inside the “floodway” of the river, the highest risk designation given by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a 2023 analysis by the University of Vermont.   Redevelopment of the two flooded parks would need to comply with town zoning and utility rules, including flood planning regulations that govern building in FEMA’s highest-risk zones. Those rules require raising homes to a specific height, limiting the use of fill in the floodway without an engineer’s sign-off that the development won’t increase flood risks nearby, among other rules. Work at the parks would require permitting through the town’s development review board, Nelson wrote in his letter. The parks would also need to be connected to municipal water and wastewater infrastructure. Nelson urged Rouleau to meet with town staff to discuss how to move forward. That meeting never happened, according to Nelson. The town’s zoning administrator, Thomas Badowski, confirmed Wednesday that the park owner had not submitted the relevant permit applications for work at the parks. Rouleau has not responded to repeated interview requests. When it comes to floodway regulations generally, Nelson said, the stakes go beyond the bureaucratic step of securing a permit for construction. “As terrible as it was for all the residents at the park last July, we were in fact lucky that nobody lost their life,” Nelson said. “That’s what we’re trying to protect here, you know, with the permitting and the floodway designations.”  The River Run park appeared largely abandoned on Tuesday, a stark contrast to the signs of redevelopment at the Berlin Mobile Home Park down the road. Asked Wednesday if he saw the owner’s work at the Berlin Mobile Home Park as illegal, Doug Farnham, chief recovery officer for the state, said, “I believe so.” In recent days, state officials have been in touch with the town about possible legal action, Farnham said.  “The state has been in contact with the town of Berlin about whether or not an injunction should be issued, and what that would look like,” Farnham said. Nelson declined to confirm whether he has been speaking with state officials about taking legal action against the park owner. But Ned Swanberg, a Vermont regional floodplain manager for Washington and Orange counties, confirmed Wednesday that conversations have been underway about legal action against the park owner. Beyond potentially placing future inhabitants of the manufactured home park at risk, flouting floodplain regulations could also jeopardize the town of Berlin’s participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, Swanberg said. Berlin takes part in a special incentive program that provides residents with a discount on flood insurance premiums, Swanberg said. When towns adopt higher regulatory standards for building in the floodplain, along with boosting public information about flooding to residents and developing detailed flood response plans, they can get lower flood insurance costs in return. Berlin has one of the strongest rankings in the state, Swanberg said, earning residents a 15% discount on premiums. If the town is negligent about development that flouts floodplain rules, it could compromise that discount for the entire town, Swanberg said. And if an egregious problem persisted, the town could be placed on probation, he added, limiting residents’ ability to get flood insurance from the federal government altogether.  “That’s not really what we’re looking at here,” Swanberg said, noting that the town has been attentive to the concerns raised at the park. “But that’s why the community is being conscientious.” Farnham, the chief recovery officer, said the site of the Berlin Mobile Home Park would be difficult to mitigate against future flooding. The park is across a bridge over the river from the main road, making it easily separated from emergency services during a flood, he said. If homes are elevated on stilts, they could still get swept away by fast-moving floodwaters. In his eyes, both the Berlin Mobile Home Park and nearby River Run would be good candidates for buyouts: an option he said officials plan to encourage the owner “to strongly consider.” ",

        "description": "This story by Robert F. Smith was first published in The Commons on June 12. BELLOWS FALLS — It has taken two years since researchers first began accumulating evidence, but on June 7, scientists announced that shortnose sturgeon are living in the Connecticut River as far north as the hydroelectric dam in Bellows Falls. Sturgeon exist in the fossil record going back 250 million years and, for thousands of years, have been native species in the Connecticut River. But this is the first time that sturgeon, which can grow up to 4.5 feet in length and live for up to 30 years, have been verified to exist in this portion of the Connecticut River since 1907. Since 2018, sturgeon had been verified only as far north as the Vernon dam. Among the data that scientists discussed and presented at the June 7 meeting at the Conte Laboratory were fishway count data on fish ladder inspections at the dams on the river and assessment reports on various species in the Connecticut River, including various fishes, American eel, and sea lamprey. Involved in the study were Micah Kieffer, a research fishery biologist since 1991, who specializes in sturgeon at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Silvio O. Conte Research Laboratory in Turners Falls, Massachusetts; Kate Buckman, the Connecticut River Conservancy’s New Hampshire River Steward, who has a bachelor’s degree in biological science from Smith College and a Ph.D. in oceanography from MIT; James Garner, a doctoral student at the University of Massachusetts and an environmental DNA specialist; and master scuba diver Annette Spaulding, who for over two decades has averaged 117 dives a year in the Connecticut River. Kieffer’s presentation included a video from New Hampshire angler Patrick Dupell, taken during the July 2023 Connecticut River flood. Kieffer reviewed the film in depth and concluded that it showed sturgeon in a flooded cornfield in Walpole, N.H., as far as a mile inland from the main river bed. Scientists have said that it is not unusual for sturgeon, during heavy flooding, to wander away from a main river into more shallow and protected flood waters. Most convincing was a video taken in 2022 by a University of Vermont student which shows sturgeon surfacing in Bellows Falls just below the hydro station at the Historical Society’s Riverfront Park. When the student found out about the sturgeon research in March of this year, he brought his video to the attention of the scientists. Kieffer said that the video has now been verified. It was taken below the hydroelectric generator run-out in Bellows Falls and shows two sturgeon at the surface of the river, one of them in unmistakable clarity. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a division of the U.S Department of Commerce, published “Recovery Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon” in December 1998.  That plan is still in effect, and lays out the operating requirements for dams in the Connecticut River watershed in order to maintain a viable spawning and survival environment for the sturgeon. NOAA has begun placing Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon information signs at popular river access sites, the first of which were installed at Riverfront Park in Bellows Falls. These show anglers how to identify sturgeon, and provide information on how to return them to the river if they are inadvertently caught. Sturgeon are protected by law and possession of sturgeon is illegal. However, to aid in the study of this ancient species, anglers and boaters are encouraged to video, photograph, and report sightings of live, injured, or dead sturgeon to the Upper Connecticut River Sturgeon Research Collaboration at 413-863-3817 or mkieffer@usgs.gov; or 413-863-3802 or btowler@usgs.gov. The input of anglers in this study is vital, Kieffer said. Anglers can often provide the most vital details needed about this species. The watershed’s hydroelectric dams can affect the sturgeon, the study says, by restricting their habitat, altering river flows and water temperatures, and causing fish deaths in plants’ turbines. At most of the dam sites in the watershed, the spawning sturgeon were located just below the dams, making them particularly vulnerable to plant operations. The NOAA sturgeon recovery plan states, “As spawning timing and locations are identified in these regulated rivers, flows that create acceptable spawning conditions should be maintained during the spawning period. Thus, the operating plans for hydroelectric generating facilities and flood storage reservoirs should include special conditions to protect shortnose sturgeon.” Because of these regulations, the verification of shortnose sturgeon in the river as far north as Bellows Falls is likely to continue to be a factor in the current process of renewing generating licenses for hydroelectric facilities on the river. Three hydroelectric dams and generating stations that are located on the Connecticut River in Wilder, Bellows Falls, and Vernon, plus two in Massachusetts, control the flow of the river over 126 miles. The dams have been in the process of renewing their operating licenses since 2012 – a process that was extended for public comment by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission until May 22. The facilities were last licensed by FERC over 40 years ago, and the five facilities had their licenses expire in April 2018. Renewed licenses are expected to be for a period of up to 40 years. The Wilder, Bellows Falls, and Vernon dams are owned by Great River Hydro, formerly known as TransCanada. The company was sold to Hydro-Quebec in February 2023. Hydro-Quebec is a corporation owned by the government of Quebec. The two Massachusetts hydro facilities, the Turners Falls Dam and Northfield Mountain Pump Storage Project, are limited liability companies owned by PSP Investments under FirstLight Power Services LLC. PSP is also a Canadian company. ",

        "description": "Drive around Vermont and you may notice that Eastern white pine trees have been turning shades of yellow and brown and shedding new needle growth.  But the trees aren’t dying, said Savannah Ferreira, the forest health specialist for the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation. They’re sick with white pine needle disease, which causes trees to lose needles infected with fungi. “Otherwise healthy trees are likely to recover from this. So although it does look really alarming now, once these needles drop, hopefully we’ll get another reflush of green needles, and it will look better for the rest of the growing season,” Ferreira said. White pine needle disease is caused by fungal pathogens that thrive in wet, humid conditions, according to Ferreira. Just like mold grows in the most humid corners of a house, the fungi that cause the disease can spread quickly if the crowns of pine trees retain moisture over time. With historic rainfall across Vermont last spring and summer, Ferreira said, fungal spores had an ideal environment to reproduce and attach to emerging pine needles. Those needles, which have grown with the disease throughout the year, are now displaying the yellow and brown hues the disease is recognized by.  And locals are starting to notice. Mike Clifford, a Killington resident, said he was concerned to see brown trees cover the hillsides along routes 107 and 4 — largely because he’s never seen anything like it before. “It’s pretty noticeable. You see all green trees, and then all of a sudden, this big clump of brown ones,” Clifford said. “It just seemed strange. … There seem to be an awful lot of these sick trees.” Ferreira said that while most reports she’s received are coming from southern Vermont, the disease is prevalent not only statewide but also across the Northeast. She said her team will conduct aerial surveying in late June or early July to measure the scope of the problem, but there is no current estimate of the extent of the damage. In the meantime, Ferreira said locals can help limit the spread of the disease by not moving plant material, such as firewood, to new areas. There is no need to cut down trees that look sick, she said, because trees that are otherwise healthy should make a full recovery once they shed their infected needles. The fungi that causes the disease is not considered harmful for animals or humans, Ferreira said. The true concern, she said, is whether or not the widespread damage being observed now will become an annual pattern.  “If we do get successive years of severe symptoms, it can cause stress (on trees) and, over time, that can definitely exacerbate other symptoms and lead to mortality,” Ferriera said. Eastern white pines grow in forests throughout Canada and the Northeastern and Middle Atlantic United States, but New England’s changing climate — specifically, its increased spring temperatures and precipitation levels — has created conditions that are the most conducive for the spread of the disease, according to a 2019 report by the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Repeated cycles of infection can “severely weaken trees” and lead to their deaths, according to the report.  Other than thinning out white pine groves to slow rates of infection and providing nitrogen fertilization to help infected trees recover, the study found that little can be done to stop the disease because of pines’ “natural abundance and large size.” Staff at the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation have been monitoring the disease since 2010, when “widespread white pine needle damage developed suddenly,” according to the department’s annual Forest Insect and Disease Conditions report. Since then, white pine needle disease has caused different levels of damage from year to year — all depending on the preceding spring’s weather conditions, which determine if fungi will latch on to new needle growth.  According to the 2023 report, the disease caused 3,349 acres of observable damage last year, largely concentrated in Windsor and Orange counties. Ferreira said she expects this year’s damage will be worse.  As recently as 2016, damage has been “widespread and severe” in more than 30,000 acres of pines, according to the department’s annual report. For now, Ferreira said all she can do is wait for trees to grow new, healthy needles and cross her fingers that the disease won’t hit Vermont as hard next year.  “It definitely hasn’t been as wet as it was last year,” she said. “So I’m staying hopeful that, next year, our trees might be able to rebound a little better.” ",

        "summary": "“This is our strategy for adapting nature to climate change,” said Robert Zaino, natural community ecologist with the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department.",
        "date": "June 9, 2024, 9:23 am",

        "description": "On a recent weekday morning, two Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department staff members pulled to the side of a dirt road in Barnet. The road was typical for the state: Its sides were lined with fields and trees, and a small house and barn lay ahead. But Jens Hawkins-Hilke and Robert Zaino — who navigated to the spot for the first time via a small map on Zaino’s cellphone — had their eyes fixed on a 100-foot section of road bordered on both sides by dense forest. “Ooh yeah, this makes me happy,” said Hawkins-Hilke, conservation planner for the department, as he exited the car. Moments later, Hawkins-Hilke and Zaino spotted a faint trail running into the forest on both sides of the road. On one side of the animal path, a deer print was visible. Bingo. The pair had come to the small town just south of St. Johnsbury to see if mapping data collected by low-flying airplanes and fed into a computer model had accurately labeled places where wildlife crosses the road en route from one ideal piece of habitat to the next. “(Wildlife road crossings) are our best hope for nature’s climate resilience — all things being able to move freely across the landscape,” said Zaino, natural community ecologist with the department. The small map on their phones was BioFinder, the Agency of Natural Resources’ publicly accessible mapping database, which shows layers of data including the shape and location of every block of interior forest, wetland, specific natural community and vernal pool in the state. Earlier this spring, the database underwent a major update that made the outlines of those habitat blocks 3,600 times more accurate. Fish & Wildlife staff say the new data will transform their efforts to support species’ abilities to move across the state: the everyday movements to find food or a mate and the larger migration afoot as species react to climate change. The data layers were created as part of Vermont Conservation Design, a project led by Fish & Wildlife that began in 2011. Hawkins-Hilke and Zaino — both of whom have been involved with Vermont Conservation Design since its infancy — said the project was sparked by the department’s mission: the conservation of all species of fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitats for the people of Vermont. It’s a tall order. “We know (about) things like bear and deer and birds and even vascular plants that we see out there all the time, but there are estimates that Vermont has 20,000 to 40,000 different species,” Zaino said. “We can’t know everything about all those species, and we can’t think about their conservation one by one. If we’re going to achieve that mission of protecting all those species and their habitats, we need to think bigger.” So the department — along with scientists from The Nature Conservancy, Northeast Wilderness Trust, Vermont Land Trust and the University of Vermont — created Vermont Conservation Design. They mapped and assigned priority ranking to all types of habitats, waterways, geological features, rare species and more. Then, all those features and their rankings were stacked on top of each other — just like in the real world — and combined into a mapping dataset that shows exactly which pieces of land are most important to conserve, versus which are more suitable for development. “When you stack all that up, we can say we have high confidence that those things, all together, maintain ecological function and the many, many species that we have in Vermont,” Zaino said. (Vermont Conservation Design is often mentioned in the Legislature in relation to an extensive 2018 state document that laid out a science-based conservation “vision” for the state, including target percentages of specific habitats to leave undeveloped or to restore. However, the project consists of both that “vision” and the prioritized data layers available in BioFinder.) Zaino explained that by getting all of those big things right — the network of habitat blocks, making sure they’re connected, making sure they represent lots of different natural communities, soils and geologies and landforms — they are giving species the best shot to do what they need to do. “We can’t, we don’t know all the species,” he said. “We know what we know, and we have to hope that we can give nature as much room to let the things we don’t know about adapt.” Looking at the entire state on BioFinder can be overwhelming: It almost looks like all of Vermont is designated as priority forest blocks. In fact, 70% of the state is classified as “high priority.” It’s still a functioning ecosystem. “I think the map of forest blocks just really drives home the fact that we live in one of the world’s greatest remaining forests,” said Gus Goodwin, senior conservation planner for The Nature Conservancy in Vermont. “We get so used to it, just having all these trees around, it’s easy to forget: It’s an overwhelming and wonderful landscape that we live in. As well as leading the charge on Vermont Conservation Design and BioFinder, Hawkins-Hilke and Zaino assist municipalities and landowners, respectively, in understanding and making thoughtful choices about the priority layers crossing their locales. “If you’re a conspiracy theorist (you might say), ‘you’re coming after my land,’” Hawkins-Hilke said. “Well, no, that’s not what we’re saying. Green doesn’t mean ‘no go.’ It could. In some places it absolutely does. But it doesn’t intrinsically mean that.” “It was never this idea that the government will buy all that land or that we’ll have regulations that cover all that land,” he explained. “The goal of Vermont Conservation Design is: These places function. They provide benefits to plants and animals and to people. Let’s maintain those functions in those places.” “That can be a whole range of conservation tools,” Hawkins-Hilke said, noting that 80% of the state is privately owned land. “Yes, it can be buying land by the government or conservation organizations. That is a tool. It can be the use value appraisal program, where landowners get a lower tax rate because they’re maintaining the land rather than developing it. But it can also be a landowner just making good, thoughtful choices about their own place and how they can contribute to ecological function. Those are all ways we can maintain this landscape, and it’s going to take all of that.” Act 171, which took effect in 2018, instructs municipalities to identify their forest blocks and habitat connectors and place them in their town plan. Conservation and planning commissions are then using that information to address development and conservation more thoroughly, such as what human uses are best for the ecological functions of a specific area. Vermont Conservation Design has also been written into a law relating to energy siting, the goal to conserve 30% of all land in Vermont by 2030 and proposed revisions to Act 250. Conservation organizations such as The Nature Conservancy also use BioFinder frequently to assess pieces of property, prioritize where to spend field resources and manage land in a more ecologically thoughtful manner. Shelby Perry, wildlands ecology director for the Northeast Wilderness Trust, works on conservation projects across six states. “All of the states have useful data, but Vermont is the only one with a comprehensive conservation design aimed at maintaining an ecologically functioning landscape,” she said in an email. An important feature of that ecologically functioning landscape is that the pieces are connected: Species travel varying distances for their daily or seasonal activities, utilizing multiple habitat blocks. For example, bobcats have a home range of 27 square miles and salamanders travel 600 feet on average in the spring and the fall. However, another kind of movement is happening, slowly but surely. According to The Nature Conservancy, species in North America are moving an average of 11 miles north and 36 feet higher in elevation each decade to adapt to climate change. And that’s not just animals that move — it’s the trout lily seeds carried by ants, burs catching onto fur as a mammal walks by, and more. When species migrate out West, it can look like huge herds galloping together. In Vermont, Hawkins-Hilke explained, this looks more like one animal at a time making its way over hill and dale. “We need to maintain this pattern of connected forest and waters to allow for all these different types of movements,” he said. A data layer within BioFinder underscores this need: Connectivity blocks are a network of habitat blocks that link all regions within Vermont, as well as adjoining states and Québec. (While you cannot see outside of the state in BioFinder, the habitats of bordering states are built into the connectivity layer.) Goodwin, who was part of the core team leading the recent BioFinder update, said that Vermont has an outsize role to play in supporting species redistribution through the entire northern Appalachians in a rapidly changing climate: linking the Taconics and Berkshires to the Green Mountains and then over to the Sutton Mountains in Québec or the White Mountains or the Blue Mountains in Maine. And they get there by crossing roads — a lot of them. (Goodwin notes that even hedgerows can be really important for wildlife). As Hawkins-Hilke and Zaino explained, that dirt road crossing in Barnet is a small but crucial piece allowing wildlife to cross from the larger patches of habitat in Groton State Forest up to Victory State Forest and then the Silvio O. Conte National Wildlife Refuge. “We don’t have a magic ball to know exactly what’s going to happen,” Zaino said. “But if we can give (species) enough room … then it’s likely that they can (adapt their ranges). The alternative is we’re gonna have to go and move these things on our own, and we’re going to get it wrong, and it’s just not gonna work because we can’t do it anyway; it’s just not feasible. “This is our strategy for adapting nature to climate change,” he added. “In doing so, that’s conserving all the benefits that people get from nature; functioning nature gives us so many benefits. And if we lose that function because species can’t move on their own, we lose the benefits like clean air, clean water, opportunities to produce our food and fiber from crop pollination to the production of timber and outdoor recreation opportunities — we lose that landscape that gives us so much.” According to Zaino, the ability to connect specific things to the big picture — for example, how trees by the road help wildlife move from the Adirondacks to the Gaspé Peninsula — is what makes BioFinder so powerful. “That’s why I think this has been so successful and why we’ve been able to really engage people, because it shows how something small is actually contributing,” he said. “It’s the sort of thing where you can take someone out to their small property and say, ‘Look! Did you know that you’re part of this?’” Zaino and Hawkins-Hilke note that there is great interest in supporting connectivity across the region and into Canada. They’ve spent time speaking about Vermont Conservation Design and BioFinder in various places, as well as working with organizations such as the Staying Connected Initiative, which focuses on habitat connectivity from New Jersey to the Canadian Maritimes. The first edition of BioFinder, released in 2013, relied on interpretations of aerial photos that produced rough and pixelated edges for each habitat block, only accurate to about 100 feet. The update to the project’s base data completed earlier this spring made the boundaries of forest blocks accurate to up to 1½ feet, which department staff have likened to “putting on a pair of glasses and finally seeing the world clearly.” Before the update, the system had a limited ability to detect wildlife road crossings — places where priority habitat runs right up to both sides of the street and wildlife are most likely to try to go across — due to the imprecision of the base data. Now, that data layer is much more complete and accurate: the site that Hawkins-Hilke and Zaino visited in Barnet is one of many not recognized in BioFinder as a wildlife road crossing until the recent update. “Roads are one of the largest fragmenting features between blocks of intact forest,” said Goodwin. “They can be both a source of mortality for wildlife as they move between the blocks of habitat that they need, and they can also become a deterrent or just an outright total barrier at a certain traffic threshold.” “We can look to other places and see what happens if you lose that (connectivity),” said Zaino. “If you lose those connected, functioning ecosystems, things change.” An example Hawkins-Hilke points to is the Eastern Newt: one of the most common species in Eastern North America, including Vermont. However, in Rhode Island, the amphibian (known there as the “Red-spotted Newt”) is listed as a “Species of Greatest Conservation Need.” In Rhode Island, the greatest threat to woodlands is land development and sprawl, which fragments habitats and causes species like the aforementioned newt to cross an increasing number of roads during the migration throughout their life cycle. In Vermont, the much more accurate and comprehensive map of useful wildlife road crossings allows Fish and Wildlife, The Nature Conservancy and other organizations to focus conservation work around road infrastructure — bridge sizes to road classes to culverts — to keep the landscape hanging together for wildlife. “I work closely with the Agency of Transportation,” said Hawkins-Hilke. “Our new hydrologic standards allow for bigger structures than ever — for climate resilience, to allow floodwaters to pass. But that also allows for wildlife movement at regular flow levels.” One such example is in Waterbury, where a 5-foot-wide and 300-foot-long culvert runs under both Interstate 89 and Route 2, separating two large forested blocks along the spine of the Green Mountains. In December, the state received a $1.6 million federal grant to kickstart a project that would replace the culvert with a 100-foot span bridge to allow for floodwater and wildlife movement. “With these updates, Vermont Conservation Design is ready to help us meet the conservation challenges of the coming decade,” Goodwin said in a statement. Within Vermont’s forested landscape lie small, specific natural communities and rare species (which Hawkins-Hilke and Zaino refer to as the “chocolate chips” in the “cookie” that is Vermont) that also need to migrate to adapt to climate change: alpine tundra, old-growth forests and specific wetlands and grasslands. On that same weekday morning in Barnet, the group also visited a northern white cedar swamp — uncommon in the state and usually smaller than 40 acres where they do occur. Cedar swamps are full of unique species: black ash, all types of mosses, rare sedges and orchids all growing on a thick layer of decomposed plants known as peat. Sometimes that layer can reach 20 feet or more deep, and scientists have found buried pollen in the “peat record” that shows how species have changed and moved over time. “It’s not like this cedar swamp packs up and everything moves across the landscape as a unit,” Zaino said. “Each species has got to go find the right combination of site and climate that’s going to work in whatever the new normal is going to be.” “We don’t know what’s going to be here in 300 years,” he said. “But by conserving good examples of all those different (natural communities) that show diversity now — and they’re diverse because of their physical context, the way the water and the land formed — those places are always likely to have different species (than the rest of the landscape) in the future.” “We may not have all the same species in the future, but we want room for whatever is going to be here; we want nature to be able to adapt,” Zaino said. “And if we have this intact, connected and diverse landscape with all these pieces, it provides room and opportunity for nature to adapt to climate change: species can move and find where they need to be in the future.” ",

        "description": "Fence posts and spools of wire are being swapped for cell phone apps and electric collars on several Vermont farms this summer as farmers pilot virtual fencing technology to manage herds of livestock. Using technology called Nofence, farmers can create virtual fence lines using a cell phone app, which communicates with animals’ collars via mobile networks and GPS tracking. The collar plays a series of tones as an animal moves closer and closer to the fence line before delivering a “mild, but effective electric pulse,” according to the Nofence website. With time, livestock learn to recognize the audio warning and will turn around before reaching the boundary. The Agritech Institute for Small Farms is running a program to test the technology in five cattle farms and four vegetation management projects across Vermont, according to a press release from the organization. Since being created by the Strolling of the Heifers nonprofit in 2022, the Agritech Institute has helped small-scale farms access the technology that has historically “passed them by,” Dan Smith, the institute’s co-founder, said.  The institute collected more than $300,000 in grant money from the Dairy Business Innovation Center, the Vermont Housing & Conservation Board and other organizations to fund the pilot program, Smith said, which means farmers can test the Nofence equipment for free during the 2024 growing season.  The project is the first in the state to test the technology, according to Nofence’s Program Manager Meghan Filbert. It is also one of the first projects of its kind in the nation, Filbert said: While Nofence has operated in Europe since 2011, the company didn’t establish a United States office until 2022. Participating farmers said they feel like they’re stepping into the future of livestock farming.  “I personally am not like a big technology person, because I think we lose track of the essentials of our job if we have too much technology. But I could immediately see the value of this app. It could really change farming dramatically,” said Sam Dixon, farm manager at Shelburne Farms. Dixon said it took his sheep only an hour to learn how their collars worked when he first set up the virtual fence in mid-May. Since then, he said he’s been able to save time by not having to constantly move and repair fences — and save money on the labor and material costs needed to do so.  Ben Nottermann, co-owner of Snug Valley Farm in East Hardwick, tested the technology last year and is rejoining the Agritech Institute this summer to participate in the full pilot program. He agreed with Dixon, saying he saves at least 45 minutes a day by moving fence lines on the Nofence app instead of physically changing the posts along his cattle’s path. When that time is added up over about 200 days of the grazing season, he said, the virtual fence “pay(s) for itself” in labor cost savings.  Nottermann said the technology is helpful in emergency situations, too. When historic rainfall struck the state last July, he said he was separated from his herd for five days due to flooding. He said the Nofence app was a “lifesaver” because he could move the fence perimeter away from flooded areas and track each cow to make sure they were safe — all while keeping himself out of harm’s way.  The four vegetation sites involved in the program will test how the fence technology can be applied in non-agricultural settings. Sheep and goats will be virtually fenced into areas such as solar arrays and ski trails to trim grasses and plants, according to the press release. While program participants observe the on-site effects of Nofence, Smith said he’ll be looking out for the wide-scale impact of the technology on the environment. Because farmers can now move their livestock to new grazing areas with ease, he said, pasture quality should improve. Rotating livestock through different grazing areas gives pastures time to regrow and allows them to remain a sustainable source of nutrients, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Pastures maintained in this way also sequester more carbon and have stable root and soil structures, which all contribute to protecting the land for future generations of farmers, the USDA said on its website. Overgrazing in one area, on the other hand, can lead to soil erosion that causes runoff and decreases water and soil quality. This can become especially dangerous during heavy summer rains, which have become more prevalent in the Northeastern United States, according to the USDA. With pasture control now available at the touch of a finger, Smith said farmers in the pilot program can work toward the sustainability goals that the Agritech Institute strives for. “Our mission is to enhance small farms’ capability to promote environmental health and well-being,” he said. “That’s the future, isn’t it?” But some local farmers are worried that the benefits of the technology won’t outweigh the cost. Because, after the pilot program ends, the Nofence equipment will no longer be provided for free.  “There’s no question that the technology works and the animals respond to it,” Dixon of Shelburne Farms said. “The big unanswered question is, ‘What is the whole cost-benefit of the expense of the technology?’” Dixon said he specifically worries about the longevity of the technology — he’s already had to change out a few of the collars’ batteries after using them for less than a month, and the Nofence equipment “isn’t cheap.”  In the U.S., Filbert said, Nofence’s cow collars are $329 each, small collars for goats and sheep are $229 each, and subscription fees to operate the collars can range from $3 to $4.50 per collar per month, depending on the size of the herd. Other farmers cited concerns in addition to the high cost, including the steep learning curve required to master the app, the lack of strong mobile networks necessary to run the app in more rural parts of the state, and the likelihood of predator attacks without physical fences to keep them off farmland.  Melanie Harrison, co-owner of Harrison’s Home Grown Farm in Addison, said she sees Nofence as a way to keep her farm financially and environmentally sustainable, even though she shares other farmers’ hesitations. “I think, as the technology becomes cheaper, (Nofence) will become more cost effective. Because, at the same time, fence materials and labor are only becoming more and more expensive,” Harrison said. “And so it’s good to try and be kind of on the forefront of that technology and be able to adapt early on.” ",

        "description": "Vermont communities will be able to tap into a new pot of federal funding this summer to fix water systems damaged by flooding and make them more resilient for the future. The state has awarded Vermont Bond Bank $6.8 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding to run the Small System Capacity and Resiliency Program, according to a press release from Gov. Phil Scott’s office.  Michael Gaughan, executive director of the Vermont Bond Bank, said the program will offer communities a chance to stay one step ahead of emergencies. “Oftentimes, the only time policymakers hear about (a water system) is when it’s a complete crisis. We want to avoid that,” Gaughan said. “Our hope is that this program will serve as a carrot to encourage long-term capital planning.” The water system recovery program will have two tiers, according to the press release. Zero-interest loans will be awarded in tier one, in which any water facility impacted by last summer’s flood is eligible to apply.  Grants and forgivable loans will be provided in the second tier, which includes all small water systems that are “at risk of failure or have failed,” according to the press release. Gaughan said any water system serving less than 10,000 people is considered “small,” and these systems do not have to have flood damage to be eligible.   While tier one applicants will receive the highest priority, Gaughan said at least $500,000 of the federal funding will be reserved for tier two.  Gaughan said the problem with water systems across the state is that many municipalities get stuck in a cycle of spending money on small-scale fixes and emergency repairs — which means they can’t save for larger infrastructure investments that would make water systems safe and effective long-term.  This Band-Aid-and-bullet-hole spiral was magnified last summer as communities attempted to repair their water systems from structural damages and contamination caused by flooding.  The Vermont Bond Bank has financed billions of dollars for local infrastructure projects since being established in 1970, which makes it a “natural fit” to run the program, Gaughan said. In 2023 alone, the bank’s loan programs financed the construction and repair of classrooms, roads, water systems and more, according to its annual report.   The Department of Environmental Conservation, which awarded the federal funding to the Vermont Bond Bank, will announce more details about how municipalities can apply to the program by the end of the month, according to the press release. In the meantime, Gaughan said his team is interviewing people affected by severe water system damage in Ludlow, Johnson and Hardwick in order to “learn as much as possible” about the effects of flooding before the formal application process begins.  “It’s intended to be an iterative process so that we’re as responsive as possible to the conditions on the ground,” Gaughan said. “We want to design a program that’s actually helpful, rather than mandating something that’s not going to be very useful in the long run.” ",

        "description": "The state of Vermont announced Monday that local municipalities may now be eligible for more money for projects that reduce future flood risk.  The state is offering to cover the local match required for towns to receive federal aid for hazard mitigation projects, according to a press release issued by Gov. Phil Scott’s office.  About $90 million is available to Vermont municipalities through the federal Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, with towns and cities required to cover 25% of costs to qualify. The state had been covering that portion for property buyouts, and will now do so for other infrastructure projects, according to Stephanie Smith, the state hazard mitigation officer for Vermont Emergency Management.  Scott said in the release that the July flooding made clear that local communities needed more resources to strengthen their infrastructure. In the past, Vermont communities have used these funds to install spillways and culverts, flood-proof buildings, restore river corridors and buy homes in floodplains, according to the release.  The state also announced it would delay its “pre-application” deadline from June 21 to Aug. 16. Smith said that the extension was meant to give more time to municipalities that may not have previously considered applying. ",

        "description": "This story by Aaron Calvin was first published by the News & Citizen on May 30. The acquisition and conservation of a 356-acre portion of woodlands in Eden will expand a broader 5,720-acre tract that has been conserved since 2010. Greatwoods LLC and the Trust for Public Land are partners in the deal. Greatwoods — a timber investor company with property located in New Hampshire, Vermont, New Hampshire, Oregon and Washington — approaches resource extraction in a conservation-minded way. It has been logging and sugaring the Eden tract surrounding its newest acquisition for over a decade but were unable to make it a truly intact forest until now. “That property was kind of the doughnut hole, it was the only piece we didn’t own around us that we tried to pursue,” Greatwoods forester Adam Taschreau said. “That’s kind of the way we’re looking at acquisitions now with the real estate market as crazy as it is. We’re basically looking to expand our core land base, and that property is one of our core properties.” The Greatwoods Eden property, now over 6,000 acres, abuts the Long Trail to the northwest and even dips into Johnson where it adjoins Butternut Mountain. It was originally conserved with funding from the U.S. Forest Service Forest Legacy Program, and this most recently conserved tract was done so with a $271,000 grant from the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board. Along with requiring a more rigorous management plan, the easement guarantees the property is open to the public for recreation, according to Trust for Public Lands senior project manager Kate Wanner. Vermont Association of Snow Travelers trails cross through the property and, though there are no hiking trails specifically cut through the area, there are plenty of forest roads to allow access. Wanner also pointed out that water quality benefits were something the trust kept in mind when pursuing conservation of the property. A third of the property is made-up of wetlands, and two-thirds of the property is considered riparian. “Keeping this as forest and keeping it with strong protections are really going to help downstream to decrease flooding and increase water quality,” Wanner said. Plugging the hole that lingered and fractured the forest block was a crucial step to ensure the integrity of the project, according to Wanner. “If that piece had been developed, it would definitely have larger implications on the conserved land around it,” she said. Greatwoods has reserved a 2-acre piece of the newly conserved portion of its forest from conservation, with no immediate plans to develop but with an interest in keeping its options open, potentially installing low-impact infrastructure if the need arises, such as a sugarhouse or collection site for the sap collected on the property, according to Taschreau.

        "description": "Vermont game warden Jeremy Schmid got a call last Friday about an aggressive bear in Underhill. When he arrived at the scene, Schmid easily recognized the 100-pound animal. It was a repeat offender, attracted that morning by recycling outside the front door of the house. “Warden Schmid decided to euthanize the bear for concerns with public safety,” said Lt. Robert Currier, the Northwestern district’s head game warden for the state Fish and Wildlife Department. Currier also noted that the animal had previously “displayed similar aggressive behavior towards another homeowner in the area.” Jaclyn Comeau, the department’s black bear project leader, called this earlier incident “unique.”  “That bear had actually displayed predatory behaviors,” she said, calling it “an exceptionally rare thing, for a black bear.” The bear, she explained, was “following and trying to sneak up on that person.” In other words, she said, “stalking behavior.” Currier said the decision to euthanize is never easy and is always made on a “case-by-case basis.” In Underhill on Friday morning, he said, the bear began to approach and circle Schmid “in a predatory stance,” while “chomping his jaws several times.” For Currier, this behavior is concretely aggressive. “No one wants to see their conflicts escalate to the point that killing the bear is necessary to protect public safety,” he said. That’s not a common outcome, according to Comeau. Last year, she said, with over 900 reports of human-bear interactions in the state, the Fish and Wildlife Department killed just two bears in conflict situations of this kind. “Some folks,” she added, “will take matters into their own hands,” and kill an aggressive bear themselves. In fact, this is significantly more frequent: There were 23 such recorded incidents last year entirely separate from hunting, she said.  Comeau urged homeowners to call their game wardens before taking action themselves. “We do have legal protections for bears,” she said. The number of reports of bears interacting with humans represents a staggering increase since a decade ago. Up until 2016, Comeau said, she would expect around 130 reports from the public each year. Then, she said, that number began to climb, with 1,700 reports in 2020, and 1,400 in 2022.Although the numbers have since dipped, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, she said. She described last year, with 900 reports, as “the craziest ‘quiet year’ we’ve had.” And while the department said in October 2023 that the Vermont bear population had hit a five-year high, Comeau doesn’t think that’s the cause of this new normal. “We have a lot of bears in pretty much every Vermont community that are what we call ‘food-conditioned’…regularly searching for human foods,” she said.  Fully 40% of the annual bear reports and sightings she and her colleagues receive involve bears trying to access trash, according to the department. Bird feeders and backyard chickens without electric fencing also cause problems. “Once these behaviors start, they usually are repeated,” said Comeau. Studies have also observed food-conditioned bears “starting to reproduce younger [and in] larger litter sizes,” according to Comeau, though they may also have higher mortality rates. “It’s going to be on us to change our behavior,” she said, adding that if Vermonters can limit bears’ access to human food, “bears will shift back to the woods and foraging for wild foods.” Some of bears’ behavioral shifts are less controllable. Comeau said that climate change is extending bear season noticeably as the state warms. Everyone, she emphasized, needs to take “bear-aware precautions for more months out of the year now than we used to have to.” The Fish and Wildlife Department has published instructions surrounding homeowner bear safety on its website. It also warns that intentionally feeding bears is a violation of state law, which Lt. Currier said could result in a $435 fine, and a year’s suspension of hunting and fishing licenses. “Vermonters have a responsibility to stop these kinds of conflicts,” said Currier. “Proactive conflict prevention is the safest thing for bears, and for people.” ",

        "description": "For $1.1 million, a state park in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom just got bigger.  Vermont’s Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation, along with the Vermont Land Trust, announced Wednesday that they had raised the funds to add the 15-acre island in Island Pond Lake, as well as a 3-acre stretch of lakeshore, to the adjacent Brighton State Park.  The purchase brings the island under state management, guaranteeing public access and protecting its natural resources. The lakeshore parcel will be used by staff to get to and from the property. “This is a really unique expansion. We don’t offer many islands in our parks, ” said Gannon Osborn, who manages land conservation projects for the Forests, Parks and Recreation department.  The island, a forested shoe print shape in the northeast corner of the lake, is an integral part of the Brighton community, according to Osborn. In the summer, kayakers paddle out to picnic on its sandy beach. Ice skaters glide across to it when the lake freezes in the winter.  The island is also home to an ecologically important red pine forest and serves as a nesting and breeding habitat for bald eagles and loons. “This is not something you see in many areas, so it’s significant for us to protect it,” Osborn said.  A family trust owned the island for years, allowing visitors and leaving the forest untouched. In 2021, however, the island went up for sale on the open market. Had it been bought by a private individual or corporation, the new owner would have had the right to raze trees, erect buildings, and restrict the public’s access.  The Vermont Land Trust, a nonprofit organization dedicated to conserving land, approached the Forests, Parks and Recreation department to propose a partnership. According to Osborn, the state had long been interested in incorporating the land into Brighton State Park.  “I was looking through some project files and we had been looking at this island back in 1993,” Osborn said.  By May 2023, the department had secured a contract for the property. Grants from the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board and the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund raised over $1 million, about 93% of the total goal. Community members and area businesses donated the approximately $76,000 still remaining.  “Projects like this require a mix of partners. The community really stepped up,” said Abby White, Vice President for Engagement at the Vermont Land Trust.  One of the conditions of the grant given by the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board was that a conservation easement be placed on the island. This is a legally binding agreement that permanently protects land from development, regardless of whether it changes hands in the future.  Noah Bond, the town manager for Brighton, was ecstatic when he heard the news of the purchase. He said he hoped the expansion of the state park would draw new visitors to town.  “We want to capitalize on that bit of the tourist economy,” said Bond.  The island is a landmark in Brighton, dominating the view from downtown in Island Pond village. Bond is thankful that it will remain uninhabited for the foreseeable future. After all, the best view of all is from his office in the town hall.   “There’s this bald eagle that comes through every year like clockwork,” Bond said. “We’re blessed that this is being protected.”  ",

        "description": "Molly Parren had no intention of rediscovering a native plant believed to be extinct in Vermont for over a century. As a turtle technician with the state’s Fish and Wildlife Department, she had simply set out to survey habitats in Addison County. But when Parren sent a picture of some rare wild garlic to Grace Glynn, a botanist with the department, she received an unexpected phone call. “You won’t believe what you’ve accidentally just found!” Glynn recalled telling Parren. Peeking into the corner of the photograph was a stem of false mermaid-weed, or Floerkea proserpinacoides. “I’d never actually seen the plant in real life,” Glynn said in an interview. “But…I immediately knew.” The herb has been missing from Vermont since the early 20th century; until last week, it was designated “state historical.” Now, experts want to make sure it stays here. It’s the latest in a series of plant “rediscoveries” in recent years. The small whorled pogonia and the purple crowberry are among the missing species that have recently been brought to light in the state.“I think it does speak to this kind of revitalized interest in native plants,” Glynn said. “It kind of takes a community to make all of these rediscoveries and that’s what we’re seeing.” According to Art Gilman, a research botanist at the University of Vermont’s Pringle Herbarium, Floerkea is actually fairly common in the rest of North America. “It’s continent-wide at about this latitude,” he explained. However, it hasn’t been spotted in Vermont since 1916, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife. And, Gilman emphasized, the plant “adds a significant element to our biodiversity as a member of a family that does not have any other representatives in the state.” Nevertheless, he added, the plant is theoretically well-suited to Vermont’s ecosystem as an early spring ephemeral. “It’s in that suite of species that are adapted…to the deciduous forest that has plenty of light earlier in the spring,” he said.  That’s an important point, according to Glynn.“The bees that are first emerging,” she said, “the flies — they really need those early plants because nothing else is blooming.” Floerkea is also tasty for humans, though little is known about its consumption by animals. But this early, short blooming period also makes Glynn’s job harder as she seeks to locate the rest of Vermont’s false mermaid-weed. “When the canopy closes over, it’s pretty much finished its business for the year,” said Gilman. Botanists, professional or amateur, who wish to seek out more false mermaid-weed this season have a limited window of opportunity. “Within a month or so,” Gilman said, “it will just be dried up and gone away…until next spring.” Without the landowners’ care for the area, and their willingness to have it examined, even this population would have been left undiscovered. “I think one takeaway here is that private land ownership and biodiversity conservation can go hand in hand with responsible stewardship,” said Glynn. She’s not just grateful to the landowners, though. “I want to give the plants credit,” she added. “They’ve been persisting without any help this entire time.” Experts will continue to study the newly uncovered population, which is already larger than originally thought. Glynn said Thursday that the population is now known to extend both up and downstream of the initial site of discovery. (The department has declined to disclose the specific location). It’s crucial to have a good sense of the plant’s spread and needs. “Ultimately,” she said, “we want to know how we can help this species flourish in Vermont in the future.” “I think there’s something kind of wonderful,” she reflected, “about being humbled and being reminded…how little we know.” A new and updated rare plant list will appear on the Fish and Wildlife Department website within the next few weeks.

        "description": "PANTON — Looking west from Route 22A, which stretches from Ferrisburgh to Fair Haven, a driver can see iconic Vermont landscapes: farm fields, rolling hills and the Adirondack mountains. If a new proposal moves forward, a portion of that view would include the largest solar array ever built in Vermont.  Residents in Panton are starting to weigh in on the size of that project, while the global company behind it pursues additional large solar arrays in two other small towns in western Vermont. Conversations about all three projects represent a broader reckoning in the state about the urgency of climate change and local skepticism towards large-scale renewable energy projects.  Freepoint Commodities, a global trading company with headquarters in Connecticut, along with its development partner, SunEast Development LLC, a renewable energy company based in Pennsylvania, have proposed the large-scale projects in Panton, Fair Haven and Shaftsbury.  At 50 megawatts  — a total fenced area of roughly 300 acres, or 227 football fields — the array in Panton would be the largest of the three, and more than double the size of any existing solar array in Vermont. The solar fields in the other two towns would each produce 20 megawatts of power and cover about 85 acres.  Lawmakers in Vermont have been wrestling to meet the state’s climate goals and reduce the state’s contribution to climate change. During the 2024 session, they passed H.289, a bill that would require Vermont’s utilities to invest more in large, local projects like the ones Freepoint and SunEast are proposing. Though Gov. Phil Scott vetoed the bill, lawmakers have identified the legislation as a priority and may vote to override the veto when they reconvene in mid-June. Meanwhile, residents in communities around the state are grappling with the scale of the projects, often arguing that large-scale solar doesn’t have a place in Vermont.  So far, around 300 people have signed paper petitions in Panton opposing the 50-megawatt project. Neighbors of the Shaftsbury project, too, have organized against the developers’ proposal. They are skeptical about Freepoint Commodities’ size, intention and deep pockets; concerned about the impact to the natural environment; and fearful that the proposals will change their towns’ rural characters and views, in part by covering agricultural landscapes with shiny glass.  “I’m for solar, I just think this scale is too big for this area,” said Mary Rudd, chair of Panton’s development review board.  The solar developers have been working to site the arrays in the three Vermont towns since 2017, according to Reed Wills, chief operating officer and co-owner of SunEast.  When Freepoint hired SunEast in 2016, the two companies decided to focus on the New England market and assessed roughly a dozen sites, looking at the possibilities for lending and potential permitting constraints in each location, Wills said.  The “biggest wildcard,” he said, is that developers have to pay for reductions in reliability that their projects could cause when they hook up to the transmission grid. “Every new entrant has to pay to keep the grid in the same condition it was before they connected,” he said.  That’s why the developers settled on the three Vermont projects: “They require no system upgrades at all,” Wills said.  The Shaftsbury project has advanced the farthest — the developers filed for a certificate of public good from the state’s Public Utility Commission in May 2023. If they receive a permit, Wills expects to begin building in 2025.  In Fair Haven, SunEast and Freepoint have given the commission notice that they will file for a certificate of public good in July, Wills said. So far, that project has not seen organized opposition, according to Wills, and no one has submitted public comments to the commission about the project. If it’s approved, construction would also begin in 2025. Wills expects to file a petition for a certificate of public good for the Panton project, named Viridis, by the end of the year, and he expects construction to begin in 2026 if it’s approved.  SunEast and Freepoint don’t have a contract with a buyer for any of the projects. They bid each project into a recent request for proposals from the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection, Wills said. The companies expect to hear back this summer.  Many opponents of the Panton project are frustrated that the power wouldn’t be sold in state — and therefore, may not contribute to Vermont’s statewide climate goals.  But Wills said it would be difficult to sell the power in-state because the developers can’t compete with the cheaper energy from Hydro-Quebec that Vermont utilities are already buying.  “The legislative changes that are out there would create opportunity for us to sell to GMP,” Wills said, referring to the recently vetoed bill, “but the current regime has us competing directly with existing Hydro-Quebec hydroelectricity, and you can’t compete with a new project against a fully depreciated project. It’s never going to work.” Many Panton residents have spoken out against the project, concerned that it wouldn’t directly serve them or their community. The town has an existing 5-megawatt solar array, which takes up about 30 acres, and has already exceeded the town’s goals for renewable energy production through 2050, said Rudd, the development review board chair.   Panton has published what Vermont law calls an “enhanced energy plan,” which designates an area of Panton for energy projects. Having such a plan gives towns a greater stake in the Public Utility Commission’s decision-making process.  SunEast tried to locate its project within the town’s preferred area, but the farmer who owned property within the area did not want to move forward with a contract, according to Wills. SunEast later adjusted the location of the project to help it comply with the town’s plan as much as possible, Wills said. Now the site “encompasses a portion, probably the lower 30 or 40%, of their preferred energy area.” Panton’s development review board plans to vote in June on whether to adjust the area designated for energy projects so that it fits SunEast’s proposal, but it appears unlikely that the board would vote in favor of the adjustment. Rudd said she hasn’t “talked to anyone” who is in favor of the project. The project could move forward even if it isn’t sited in the town’s preferred area, but that could make securing approval from the Public Utility Commission more challenging.  Panton resident Sharon Ashcraft, who has organized a group of people opposed to the project called “No Mega Solar,” pointed to the project’s proximity to the Dead Creek Wildlife Management Area, which is important habitat for migrating birds and other wildlife, as a concern.  Ashcraft also said she’s worried the industrial nature of the project would change the character of the town. “We just don’t think that’s the best use of this area,” she said. “Tourism in Vermont is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, economic factors. And something like this, with people going up and down the 22A corridor — people come to Vermont for the open rural landscape, and if that’s going to disappear, that’s going to affect the statewide economy.” Rudd is also worried about the appearance of the project. In mid-May, standing at a quiet intersection between two big farm fields that would host the solar panels, she gestured up the sloped land to VT-22A, a 45-mile-long highway that runs along through west central Vermont.  “You can’t screen this from above,” she said.  Others have cited the project’s placement on active agricultural land. Most of the land included in the proposal, owned by the Marszalkowski family, is used to grow soy, corn and wheat, according to Sam Marszalkowski, a Rutland resident who spoke to VTDigger on behalf of her family members who farm the land. They sell their products locally, to feed companies and directly to farmers, she said.  But the family members who farm the land do not own it, according to a letter to Panton officials from Alex Marszalkowski, who identified himself as the trustee of Mary’s Trust, which owns the farm. The leasing of land would provide funding to support nursing home expenses for Mary Marszalkowski, Alex’s grandmother, he wrote in the letter. Sam Marszalkowski declined to speak with VTDigger about the farm’s ownership structure.  Alex Marszalkowski lives in Rhode Island, where he is a state representative, while Joseph Marszalkowski, Sam’s brother, and their father, Richard Marszalkowski, actively farm the land.  SunEast first entered into a contract in 2018 to construct a solar project with the members of the Marszalkowski family who operate Mary’s Trust, according to Wills and town land records. Sam Marszalkowski said her immediate family members didn’t learn about the contract until the second half of 2023. Among the members of the family who are actively farming the land, there is “great concern” about the project, Sam said. “The main concern isn’t with solar power itself, as it’s clear that it’s a vital and promising renewable energy source,” she said. “The main issue lies in the lack of transparency surrounding such major, extensive solar projects.” “How can we build up a local infrastructure that has the input from residents, environmentalists, the state of Vermont itself, and then develop from there, versus an out-of-state company coming in trying to sink their claws, so to speak, on what is going to benefit another part of our country?” she said. Rudd, too, said many of the town’s questions have gone unanswered by the solar developers.  Wills said SunEast is still finalizing the details of the project, in part because the company recently moved it in an attempt to comply with the town’s energy plan. They held an informational meeting for residents earlier in May and plan to hold another meeting next month, he said. More information about the exact size of the project, the number of panels used and other details will become available as the company prepares to file its petition with the Public Utility Commission later this year.  As the United States attempts to electrify cars, homes and businesses, those concerned about climate change often cite the need to generate that electricity using carbon-free sources, like solar.  Those who oppose the projects in Panton and Shaftsbury say they aren’t opposed to solar in general, but want to ensure that projects are sited thoughtfully, without impacts to the local culture or environment.  Ashcraft, who opposes the Panton project, is concerned that large solar companies are “targeting rural communities, because that’s where the land is.” Bill McKibben, an Addison County resident, author and activist who advocates for renewable energy, said at “first blush,” the project seemed “like a good idea to me.” In terms of environmental impact, the crops being produced on the land now, he said, are ones “that we really don’t need very badly,” but “clean electrons is a crop that we use an immense amount of here.” “We have a huge carbon debt to the rest of the world, because we’ve been using fossil fuel to produce power for a very long time,” he said.  Ashcraft said solar panels could instead be placed on the rooftops of schools and shopping centers, and over parking lots. “It’s already land that’s been developed, but isn’t being put to good use,” she said.  Peter Sterling, executive director of the trade group Renewable Energy Vermont, said placing projects on rooftops is often more expensive, and the state’s net metering program “doesn’t really make that scalable.” “We clearly need to come up with a way to make sure those projects are affordable and produce affordable power. That’s important,” Sterling said. “There’s also the balance of putting some larger projects, which generally produce cheaper power — you know, economies of scale and all — into appropriately sited spaces, preferably ones that are already open.” ",

        "description": "Cecilia Larson is a reporter with Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program. Forged by the American Forest Foundation and the Nature Conservancy, a program that pays people to set aside forest to store carbon has been growing in Vermont over the last two years. The Family Forest Carbon Program launched in 2020 in Pennsylvania, and after learning from the foresters, stakeholders and landowners down there, its organizers migrated north in the summer of 2022 seeking to benefit Vermont communities. Since then, those involved say, close to 500 landowners have expressed interest in enrolling in the program and being paid close to $300 an acre, dispersed over a 20-year period, for preserving the sequestered land. People must own at least 30 acres of naturally growing trees to join. Programs like this have existed nationally for a while, but their focus often has been limited to large plots of land, thousands of acres at a time, and were expensive to operate, said University of Vermont professor and forest scientist Bill Keeton. The Family Forest Carbon Program sought to bring a solution to the small forest owner, someone who wants to play a part in reducing atmospheric carbon and also improve biodiversity by encouraging birds and critters to stick around.  In Vermont, some 80% of forestland is owned by small landowners, who in the past have had limited options for carbon storage programs, according to Jim Shallow, director of strategic conservation initiatives for the state branch of the Nature Conservancy, one of the country’s largest environmental nonprofits.  The program is linked to voluntary carbon markets, in which companies and other organizations can pay to offset their emissions by buying what are called carbon credits. Imagine a ticket that represents a certain amount of carbon emissions either kept or removed from the atmosphere — that’s a carbon credit. Those tickets come from places like the forests in the Family Forest Carbon Program. The markets face relatively little regulation — though one federal agency has been looking to change that — and the credits they trade have been criticized as scams vulnerable to fraud. Supporters see the potential positive impact of these programs for combating climate change and preserving forests, natural guards against excess carbon. About 97,000 acres of Vermont land are in the process of coming under the program, with 38 contracts fully signed so far covering close to 7,500 acres, Shallow said. The program has faced challenges of high interest and low capacity, which its leaders are facing head on. “It’s a good problem to have, in my opinion,” Shallow said. Fred Pond, a UVM librarian and avid woodsman, enrolled his land early in the program. His property, 140 acres in Tunbridge purchased in 1999, had been forested heavily and unsustainably, he said. After a period of healing, and with help from a state tax break to incentivize undeveloped forests, Pond said his land grew back into a flourishing ecosystem. Since enrolling his property in the program, Pond said he’s cultivated healthy greenery on his land. With the money he makes from the program, he hopes to buy an electric tractor. The success of the program is measured through monitoring plots on enrolled properties. Each year, program workers go out and measure the tree growth happening on a given property and compare it with trends on a similar but unenrolled property. Many of the landowners enrolled in this program are passionate outdoorspeople, said Tim Stout, who has managed his family’s multigenerational farm for the last 47 years and has land in the program. He said his 175 acres of mostly woods is open to the public for anyone interested in exploring nature. “I love to get kids and older adults, anyone regardless of age, out to enjoy the forest,” Stout said. “They’ve made, in my mind, great progress in improving the scientific integrity of the program,” he said of the effort. Eli Enman of Huntington owns and operates the Sleepy Hollow Inn. He has 700 acres of forest in the program, with tons of bike and ski paths throughout. The first payments have allowed him to help finance an electric snow groomer to tend to ski slopes during the season. “It really allowed us to kind of make an environmentally good decision,” Enman said. What does the program’s growth in Vermont mean in the big picture? Keeton, the UVM forest ecosystem scientist, put it into perspective.  Keeton said programs like this one have courted controversy. They’ve been labeled inauthentic by some; skeptics have claimed carbon credits that came from sequestration programs were not valid; and the programs put a bad look on all market-based solutions. But Keeton said the Family Forest Carbon Program is one that can back up its claims. “In some ways, that program has kind of led the way and has kind of shown that this can work and has sort of moved the needle in showing that there can be real climate benefits,” said Keeton.

        "description": "The Vermont Supreme Court has denied a request from the owners of a Panton dairy farm that would have alleviated the burden of a court order issued in March 2022, which requires the farm to make expensive changes in order to stop runoff from flowing across a neighbors’ land and into Lake Champlain.  The decision stemmed from a six-day trial that played out in an Addison County courtroom in December 2021 and January 2022.  The high-profile case prompted closer scrutiny of the state’s regulatory system and moved lawmakers to consider strengthening the state’s right to farm law, which protects farmers from nuisance cases. “The facts remain unchanged in the record before us, and they do not justify, as the trial court stated, ‘modification or elimination’” of the 2022 order, Supreme Court Justice Karen Carroll wrote in the decision issued Friday.. The Hoppers, a family that owns land on the shore of Lake Champlain, brought the case against farmers Hans, Gerard and Rudy Vorsteveld in April 2020, alleging that the farmers were channeling a large amount of runoff through their land and into the lake.  During the jury trial, the Vorstevelds explained that the runoff was coming from their tile drains, perforated pipes that are buried three-feet deep in the soil and empty into common discharge points, which then direct the water over the Hoppers’ land and into the lake. Farmers use tile drains as a tool to improve soil quality and encourage crop growth by draining water from the soil, which is rich in clay in Addison County.  “Sediment and particles carried by the water have increased phosphorus and E. coli concentrations in Aerie Point’s farm pond and have caused algae blooms in the lake,” Carroll wrote in her decision. To stop the runoff, the Vorstevelds would likely need to remove the drainage infrastructure, a process that could damage the land and cost millions of dollars, according to court documents.  Addison Superior Court Judge Mary Teachout issued the 2022 decision stating that the farmers needed to find a way to stop the runoff. Then, the Vorstevelds missed a deadline to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court’s decision issued on Friday came in response to a request the farmers filed in August 2023, asking for relief from Teachout’s 2022 order. Among several arguments, the Vorstevelds said “any measure (the farm) could take to prevent water runoff would be expensive, impractical, and unsustainable,” Carroll wrote in a summary of the Vorsteveld’s request.  The Vorstevelds also argued that an Environmental Protection Agency investigation regarding filled wetlands on the farm prevented the farmers from complying with court orders. Another argument the farmers presented was that the Hoppers could no longer claim that they suffered harm from the runoff because they no longer grazed animals on the affected land. Also, some areas on the Hoppers’ land that had previously seen erosion had been resolved, they argued, according to the description within the Supreme Court’s order. Finally, the Vorstevelds argued that a change to Vermont’s right to farm law, which took place in 2022 after the judgment was issued, meant that they were being held “to a higher standard of farming practices than other Vermont farms.” Carroll wrote that the Vorstevelds seek to “relitigate issues relating to the injunction that were decided at trial and in posttrial proceedings and (have) not demonstrated that there is a significant  change” in circumstances that arose after the 2022 order. Separately, Teachout, the Addison Superior Court judge, ruled earlier this year that the farmers were in contempt of court because they had not made efforts to solve the runoff problem. While they had been “considering costly and logistically complex solutions,” Teachout wrote at the time, the farmers “did not begin to develop compliance plans” until the contempt hearing “was imminent.” When Teachout issued the contempt order, she gave the Hoppers and the Vorstevelds four months to engage in mediation and to form a plan for the farm. The discussions have ended without an agreement, according to Merrill Bent, attorney for the Hoppers, who said she filed a motion earlier this week for additional contempt sanctions as a result.  “The ecological damage caused by the farm’s discharges has continued this whole time,” Bent said in an email. “It is time for the Farm to stop making excuses and comply with the law and the court’s orders.” Claudine Safar, attorney for the Vorstevelds, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

        "description": "CORNWALL — Jill Kilborn spent the morning of May 16 in tall wading boots, roaming the wet, grassy expanses of a newly conserved, 110-acre piece of land and looking for birds.  An abundant assortment of songbirds made themselves known that morning through a chorus of clicks, chirps and more elaborate melodies. Listening closely, Kilborn deciphered members of the symphony: a wood thrush, a common yellowthroat, a scarlet tanager, a Savannah sparrow.  “There’s the R2-D2 bird,” said Kilborn, who is the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department’s nongame bird project leader. She pointed toward a black and white bird with a yellowish cap, fluttering above a meadow. “That’s that weird ‘beloobeloobeloo’ bubbling kind of noise — those are the bobolinks.” The Fish & Wildlife Department purchased the property in March from Betty Lou Gorton and partnered with the Vermont Land Trust and the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board to conserve it. It’s now part of the more than 1,600-acre Lemon Fair Wildlife Management Area, which sits on the Cornwall-Bridport town line.  The land is open to the public for birdwatching, cross-country skiing, fishing, hiking, hunting and wildlife observation. It features views of the Adirondacks and Addison County’s iconic agricultural hillsides. Big red barns sit on a slope just beyond the boundaries of the wildlife management area. But the property serves an important purpose beyond human enjoyment: Conserving it is part of a strategy to attract and protect certain species of grassland birds, which face increasing threats in Vermont. Earlier that morning on the Cornwall property, Kilborn had spotted an eastern meadowlark perched on a fence. Listed as a threatened species in Vermont in 2022 — meaning that its population is declining, and, unless protected, could become endangered— the meadowlark faces a number of challenges in Vermont and across the country.  The New England and Mid-Atlantic population of meadowlarks has declined by more than 95% over the last 50 years, according to the Vermont Center for Ecostudies.  A member of the blackbird family, the meadowlark is a little bigger than a robin, has a yellow chest marked with a dark V-shape, and makes a slow, whistling call. It lives all over the eastern United States and southeastern Canada, but the birds that breed as far north as Vermont typically travel south for the winter. Officials are still finalizing a recovery plan to help meadowlarks and four other grassland species on Vermont’s threatened and endangered list: the upland sandpiper, grasshopper sparrow, sedge wren and Henslow’s sparrow.  According to Kevin Tolan, a staff biologist with the Vermont Center for Ecostudies who authored the plan, much of that recovery hinges on finding and appropriately managing a habitat that supports the life cycle of those species. That’s where land like the Lemon Fair management area fits in. The new parcel of state land includes an array of habitats — patches of forest, a river, brushy areas and active agricultural fields, which create different types of grasslands. Meadowlarks prefer grasslands that are actively grazed by cows, because the grasses vary in structure.  “A lot of people don’t realize: Just like we manage our forests for diverse, complex structure, grasslands are the same way,” Kilborn said.  After European settlers clear cut most of Vermont’s land in the 1800s to make way for farmland, grassland birds found a home in fields that had previously been forest. Although the state once had natural grassland habitat before it was clearcut, scientists don’t have clear records to show which grassland birds lived in Vermont then, according to the Fish & Wildlife Department.  Either way, Vermont’s agricultural fields have become an increasingly important refuge for them as similar habitats in the Midwest have been lost to more intensive, monoculture agricultural practices.  “We’ve lost so much across their range that at this point, every acre counts,” Kilborn said. “And Vermont can contribute to it because we have that rich agricultural history.” Grassland birds are caught in a tricky spot: Their success in Vermont depends on a specific type of human management. If the work is not timed precisely, the birds are threatened by the very practices that create their habitat. In particular, grassland birds such as the meadowlark and the bobolink nest in the grass, and those nests run the risk of being destroyed when farmers hay the fields.  Vermont has lost a lot of its agricultural land to development, and farmers are mowing more frequently and earlier in the spring, which increases the risk to nests, according to Tolan. “People are haying like 10 days earlier than they had, but because they base their yearly rhythm around the sun and the solar period, the birds are returning at the same time,” Tolan said. “And so we’re starting to see a mismatch in how the management has occurred in the past and how it’s occurring now.” Also, invasive plants have crept into the fields, and their presence is likely impacting the birds, though scientists don’t know to what extent, Tolan said. He’s also concerned that birds might be eating seeds coated with neonicotinoids, a pesticide used to protect crops such as corn and soy from pests. Legislation is pending in Vermont that would ban some uses of the seeds, but farmers in many parts of the country use the pesticides, including some states where the birds spend the winter.  “And then of course, as agriculture moves out of Vermont, you’re seeing a lot of these fields reverting back to forest,” Kilborn said.  Dedicating a field to grassland “could either be really good or really bad for a bird,” Tolan said. If it’s managed in a way that hurts the birds — for example, by cutting hay while the birds are nesting — it could act as a “sink,” drawing birds to the area only to hurt their population.  The Fish & Wildlife Department licenses farmers who manage grasslands at the state’s wildlife management areas, said Will Duane, land acquisition coordinator for the department.  “It works nicely with folks who are nearby and need the pasture,” he said.  In Cornwall, farmer Eugene Ethier manages the land in the wildlife management area in partnership with the department. Ethier, whose farm abuts the state land and whose family has been farming the land for generations, coordinates with the department to time his hay harvest so it won’t damage nests.  Many grassland birds stay “very, very close to their natal site,” Tolan said. “They come back to the same field year after year. So if you have a big field like that, that’s managed long term in a bird-friendly manner, it will create a source population that will basically feed the entire area.” ",

        "description": "This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public. As Vermont sees temperatures spike for the first time this year, unhoused people who lack stable access to shelter face limited options as they try to stay cool. Amid a rise in homelessness, the state’s shelters are typically full. During the coldest months of the year, the state has historically opened up access to its backstop to the shelter system — the motel housing program — to anyone experiencing homelessness. But no such parallel exists for heat waves, or other summertime hazards, such as poor air quality from wildfire smoke. As Vermont braces for more extreme weather conditions in the future, some say the state’s response to homelessness needs to adapt, too. “For me, the cold weather opening of the motels is really grounded in a Vermont climate that doesn’t really exist anymore,” said Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central. “Our thinking is pretty behind the realities of climate change at this point.” Some daytime options do exist for unsheltered Vermonters to escape the heat. The state Department of Health maintains a list of cooling sites with access to air conditioning or water, such as libraries, community centers and state parks.  Some communities have existing day centers where unsheltered people can access services indoors — like Burlington’s COTS Daystation, which reportedly saw an uptick in traffic during a heat wave last September — and have outreach teams that bring cold water to people living in encampments.  Yet service providers say they’re stretched thin as they attempt to meet the needs of a growing number of Vermonters living out in the elements, particularly after hundreds of people were evicted from the motel program last June. In Chittenden County alone, providers estimate that around 200 to 240 people are living outside. “Ultimately, the bottom line is we have too many people out on the streets, and not enough capacity to serve them,” said Paul Dragon, executive director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity.  State funding has supported a modest increase in the number of shelter beds available statewide over the last year: capacity has been added for about 110 households, for a total capacity of 547 households, though that number shifts as seasonal shelters open and close and new projects come online, according to an email from Department for Children and Families spokesperson Nya Pike. Lawmakers allocated about $7 million for permanent shelter bed expansion — and another $10 million intended for emergency winter shelter capacity — for the coming fiscal year, which begins July 1.  The Department for Children and Families is now reviewing applications for some of that funding, according to an emailed statement from Lily Sojourner, director of the department’s Office of Economic Opportunity.  But the state’s year-round capacity for the motel program will be shrinking. Beginning Sept. 15, a 1,100-room cap will go into effect, a measure lawmakers wielded to rein in costs as the state scales back the program’s pandemic-era expansion. The room cap will be lifted during the winter, though eligibility during the colder months will be more limited than it has been in the past. (Gov. Phil Scott has not yet signed the new policy into law, but has signaled his support for it).  Because the motel program currently shelters around 1,500 households — all of whom are deemed vulnerable, based on criteria set in part by lawmakers — the room cap, along with a new 80-day limit on motel stays, will force people out of shelter. “We’re extremely concerned that they put the caps in place in terms of who has access to shelter in the summer,” said Frank Knaack, executive director of the Housing and Homelessness Alliance of Vermont. “Our shelter system is already completely maxed out.” For unhoused Vermonters with acute health conditions, opening up motel stays during extreme heat could be a lifeline, Dragon said. “We know that many of the people that we see have cardiovascular issues, high blood pressure, diabetes — and it makes their condition much more vulnerable in extreme hot weather.” Vyhovsky hopes adjusting the state’s motel program policy to address weather hazards outside of the winter months can be a part of the conversation during the 2025 legislative session. “What can we do right now, to make sure that on any given day when there are alerts going out about not being outside — that we’re making sure no one has to be outside?” Vyhovsky said.

        "description": "Vermont is forecast to hit temperatures in the upper 80s in the next two days, far above normal for this time of year, the Burlington branch of the National Weather Service reported on Monday.  Parts of the state, particularly the Champlain Valley and Connecticut River Valley regions, could see a high of 90 degrees on Wednesday, according to weather service meteorologist Brooke Taber. That’s 15 to 20 degrees above the average temperature for this point in May.  The spate of high temperatures isn’t quite long enough for the weather service to issue a heat advisory, but Taber said vulnerable Vermonters, such as people with health conditions or people who work outside, should be cautious in the coming days.  “It’s sort of our first heat of the season, too, so we’re not adjusted to the heat yet,” he said. He advised anyone spending time outside to stay hydrated and take breaks. The good news is that it’s not expected to be uncomfortably humid, Taber said, and the temperature is expected to drop during the night, giving Vermonters some relief from the heat.  Despite the heat, meteorologist Adrianna Kremer warned that water temperatures can still be cold. Lake Champlain, a large body of water, remains in the upper 50s and 60s. At that point, “immersion can be life threatening,” she said.  She said Vermonters pursuing water-based recreational activities should don a life vest and continue to follow basic cold water safety guidelines.  The weather is forecast to take a cooler turn for Memorial Day weekend, with highs in the upper 60s to low 70s, Taber said.  But early predictions for this summer are looking warm, Taber said. The federal Climate Prediction Center has said the Northeast has a high probability of above-average temperatures, based on the outlook of regional weather patterns.  ",

        "description": "Over the last several years, a debate over how to manage wildlife has become a symbol of a broader cultural divide in Vermont. During the recently concluded legislative session, that debate culminated in S.258, a bill that would have changed the state’s wildlife management structure.  Many supporters of the measure saw it as a pathway to create common ground between those who want to protect wildlife from certain hunting practices and those who fear the implications of a cultural shift away from hunting in Vermont.  Some lawmakers who opposed the bill — or didn’t want to vote on it — feared it would prompt more division. That appears to be the reason the bill failed.  It became a “lightning rod for some of the intensity around” the wildlife debate, said Rep. Katherine Sims, D-Craftsbury, co-chair of the tripartisan Rural Caucus.  S.258 focused largely on the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Board, a citizen group in charge of creating rules to manage the state’s game species. At present, it is stacked with hunters, trappers and anglers. While the governor currently appoints its 14 members, the bill would have added two new members appointed by the Legislature. All board members would have been required to meet a list of qualifications and participate in training.  Moreover, the bill would have made the Fish & Wildlife Board advisory and transferred power to the state’s Fish & Wildlife Department to make rules that govern hunting, trapping and fishing. It would have also banned the controversial practice of hunting coyotes with dogs. Sims said the rural caucus did not take a formal position on the issue and that members from  rural districts and more populous areas were hesitant to support the bill. The caucus heard from stakeholders who advocated for and against the bill, she said.  Representatives were “hearing loudly from a lot of constituents with lots of different diverse perspectives,” she said. “And I think that’s my sense of why the bill didn’t move forward: that many members felt like they would be taking a vote on a bill that might divide their community.” Sims also pointed to a process that had played out before the session. In response to two laws passed in 2022, the Fish & Wildlife Board created rules to govern trapping and hunting coyotes with dogs. When the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules argued that the board’s rules didn’t go far enough, the board approved them anyway. Then came S.258.  “I think we do our best work when everyone comes together and finds consensus and moves forward together,” Sims said. This time, the bill felt like a “reaction to frustration about the LCAR process and the rules,” she said. “I don’t think it was the right bill at the right time,” she said, adding that she’s “committed to continuing to be a part of these conversations.” Patti Komline, a lobbyist with Downs Rachlin Martin, represented the group Animal Wellness Action, which supported the bill. She said she’s worked on controversial issues, including gun control, but that this one got people particularly “fired up.” “People told us they got a thousand emails, about equally split, both for it and against this bill,” Komline said. “And really, what legislators felt is, they didn’t want to go into an election cycle where they’re alienating half the people. There was no right vote to take on this.” Sims is among the legislators who could face political implications. The Craftsbury Democrat recently entered a race for an open state Senate seat in rural Orleans County.  Lawmakers couldn’t simply split the bill and remove one part of it to make it more politically appealing, Komline said, because people were divided over both of its major parts: the changes to the board and the ban on coyote hounding.  Before it faced opposition in the House, the bill saw a strong show of support in the Senate — but not at first. The original version called for an even split of hunters and non-hunters on the Fish & Wildlife board. When other senators expressed concern about that proposal, Sen. Chris Bray, D-Addison, the bill’s author, walked it back, adding the two legislative appointees to the board instead.  With that change, S.258 passed the Senate with enough votes to override a likely veto by Gov. Phil Scott. But after it moved to the House, it became stuck in its first committee, House Environment and Energy.  As the session approached its end, Rep. Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury, who chairs the House committee, said the bill didn’t have the votes to override a veto in the House and that the committee had stopped taking testimony on it.  “We’re not going to move it if it doesn’t look like it has a future,” Sheldon said in an interview on May 1.  Bray told VTDigger he isn’t sure yet whether he’d take the issue up again in another session.  “I realized it was hard on my colleagues,” Bray said. “So, you know, I’m not going to jump back in without being really clear and intentional and have conversations with folks.”  ",

        "summary": "A new treatment under review could help improve lake quality, state officials and locals say.",

        "article_link": "https://vtdigger.org/2024/05/15/state-to-remove-lake-carmi-aeration-system-after-determining-it-made-cyanobacteria-blooms-worse/",
        "description": "State officials have decided to begin removing an aeration system in Lake Carmi and may soon move forward with an alum treatment after finding the system actually exacerbated conditions creating harmful cyanobacteria in the lake. The aeration system was installed to try and mitigate cyanobacteria blooms, which is sometimes called blue-green algae. Officials found it had “unintended consequences” of mixing phosphorus-rich bottom water with the rest of the lake, according to minutes from an April 16 meeting of the state’s Lake Carmi Coordination Team. That led to higher levels of phosphorus in the Franklin County lake’s surface water and “stronger, more protracted cyanobacteria blooms.” “We have seen high levels of bloom reports every year since the original system has been on now,” Peter Isles, an environmental scientist with the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, said in an interview. “Through various lines of evidence … it does seem to have gotten worse.” Lake Carmi, a 1,375-acre body of water located in Franklin just a few miles south of the U.S.-Canada border, has been plagued by severe cyanobacteria blooms for years, with major beach closures routine throughout summer seasons. Lake Carmi State Park boasts the largest campground in Vermont, drawing tourists from Canada as well as throughout the state, and the blooms have been a drag on tourism and recreation. “We had some awful, awful years,” said Rob Evans, the vice president of the Lake Carmi Campers Association. “We had algae blooms so thick that it looked like you could walk across our lake.” The state has worked for decades to limit phosphorus runoff into the lake. An agreement with the federal Environmental Protection Agency in 2009 aimed to reduce phosphorus coming into the lake by 40%. In 2018, the state declared Lake Carmi “a lake in crisis,” a designation that gave the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources authority to intervene. It opted to install the $1 million aeration system in 2019, in part because it was less invasive than other treatment options, Isles said.  The system worked by sending compressed air through a tube to a “manifold,” which shot the air into 40 different pipes spread out at the bottom of the lake. It was partly successful in reducing thermal stratification, a process that encourages the release of phosphorus at cooler bottom layers. But the system repeatedly malfunctioned, making it difficult for state officials to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the system. Still, officials, observing an increase in blooms over three consecutive summer seasons, suspected that the system was not working effectively. “That made the decision to discontinue it easier,” Isles said. “It’s not just that it wasn’t working so well. It’s that we really thought it was making it worse.” The system will be removed in the fall, according to the Lake Carmi Coordination Team minutes. Officials said it’s unclear how much that will cost.  Evans said he doesn’t see the aeration system’s failure as a setback and pointed to the state’s continued investment into the lake. “We’ve had several state agencies that were willing to invest a significant amount of money in what they hoped was going to be a solution, and unfortunately, it’s not,” he said. “I commend the state for not trying to continue to push it and wish that a system was going to work (when) the data showed us that the system is not working.” Now, the state and local community hope to move forward with a new treatment that would use aluminum sulfate to combat cyanobacteria in the water — a strategy that has been used in other Vermont lakes and one officials say could help combat the legacy nutrients that have built up over decades. A feasibility study conducted by Barr Engineering, which began in October and is now being finalized, confirmed that blooms are being driven by nutrients at the bottom of the lake and concluded that aluminum treatment would significantly reduce phytoplankton blooms and improve lake clarity. Officials have pegged the cost of treatment at roughly $2.6 million. Since aluminum naturally binds with phosphorus, the objective of that treatment would be to keep phosphorus locked into the lake’s sediment and thus unable to fuel cyanobacteria growth.  Lake Morey, in Fairlee, had a “very successful” alum treatment in 1986 and is in “better shape” since the treatment, according to meeting minutes from the Lake Carmi Coordination Team meeting. Aluminum sulfate, at certain pH levels, can be toxic to certain organisms, but federal EPA and state guidelines ensure that treatments stay within acceptable thresholds, Isles said. Brooks Sturtevant, the vice chair of the Franklin Selectboard, said he knows some residents who “are concerned about putting chemicals into a lake that is already dealing with chemical issues.” But, he continued, “in my conversations, from what I have heard, it’s more like, ‘Let’s try something that hopefully works.’ There seems to be some optimism.” The state plans to review the draft feasibility study, according to Bethany Sargent, the deputy director of the state Department of Environmental Conservation’s watershed management division. If it determines that it’s a feasible option, the town of Franklin or the Lake Carmi Campers Association could then apply to the state for a permit to carry out the treatment.  Treatment could begin as early as next spring or by the fall of 2025, Sargent said. Neil Kamman, the director of the Department of Environmental Conservation’s water investment division, said the state’s Clean Water Board approved $750,000 for Lake Carmi for fiscal year 2025 budget — which could help pay for the treatment.  The remaining balance, Kamman said during the April 16 Lake Carmi Coordination Team meeting, could be covered through several options. He recommended the town and community apply for a forgivable loan through the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund — dollars that would be available in spring of next year. Other options included a direct request to the federal delegation for congressionally directed spending or for state capital appropriations. For now, Evans said he and the community remain “cautiously optimistic” that they’re on a good path forward. “I think anything that can help, people are willing to try,” Sturtevant said. ",

        "description": "The Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department is urging motorists to watch out for turtles crossing roads during their peak breeding season, which begins now and will continue until roughly mid-June. Drivers should be especially aware on roads near ponds, rivers and wetlands, according to a Monday press release from the department.  “Turtles are usually slow to move, so they have a tough time safely crossing roads,” Luke Groff, a biologist with the department, said in the release. In addition to being vigilant while driving, department officials suggest helping encountered turtles cross the street — but only when it’s safe to do so.  “If you can safely move it, please do, but also respect that that’s a wild turtle and that is where it belongs,” Groff said in an interview with VTDigger. “So we don’t collect turtles. We don’t bring them home.” He also emphasized it’s important to make sure the turtles stay the way they were facing. “We don’t move them to what we think is a better spot. We move them across the road and trust that they know best.”   “They know where they’re going,” he noted in the release. When helping a snapping turtle, the department advises that motorists use a shovel, piece of cardboard or a car floor mat to move them, and to err on the side of caution when trying to differentiate snappers from other species. “If the turtle is large or if it lacks colorful lines, spots, or other markings, then it may be a snapper,” according to the press release.   In addition to traversing roads, turtles are known for turning roadsides, driveways and yards into nesting sites this time of year.  “If there’s not an immediate danger to that nest, I typically recommend people leave them in place. You know, even if that’s on the fringe of your driveway, if you could just mark it, leave the nest there, that is going to always be the best thing for the turtle,” Groff said.   However, if a nest resides in a particularly vulnerable location, Groff encouraged people to contact the Department of Fish & Wildlife to help relocate it. Groff also recommended helping the turtle hatchlings cross the street if they’re in danger of getting hit.  “If there’s a busy road between that nest and the water, then the turtle will have instincts to go to the water,” Groff said. “If there’s a road between there, you know, those hatchlings are not going to fare well. So I always recommend if people can do it, and can do it safely… to certainly give those little hatchlings a head start and a walk across the road.” Accidents involving turtles can have serious implications for their populations if their numbers are already small. “Many turtles killed on roads are mature breeding females, so not only is the female taken from the population but so are her future offspring,” Groff said in the release.   “Turtles grow slowly and females of some species may not reproduce until 10 or even 15 years old,” he added.  ",

        "description": "Bills related to animal welfare, pesticide use and pet stores are headed to the governor’s desk. A fourth agriculture-focused bill, which would have allowed farmers to more easily repair their equipment, lost support in its final stages and will not become law this session.  H.626 is an answer to a number of animal cruelty cases across the state and the longstanding lack of a single designated governmental entity to investigate and respond to such cases.  “This is an issue where the ambiguity ultimately creates situations where animal cruelty persists,” Sen. Anne Watson, D-Washington, told fellow senators while presenting the bill last week. The bill would create a new Division of Animal Welfare, to be housed in the Department of Public Safety, and it designates a single employee to be the division’s director. That person would be required to develop a comprehensive plan for handling animal cruelty cases.  Watson said lawmakers opted to give the public safety department responsibility for animal cruelty cases rather than another state agency such as the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets or the Department of Fish & Wildlife because, “when animal cruelty happens, it often rises to the level of a crime.” “And as a result,” Watson continued, “it needs to be dealt with with all of the standards that are expected to be seen with handling evidence in preparation for a trial.” The bill has passed through both chambers and will soon head to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk.  H.706 would ban certain uses of neonicotinoids, a type of pesticide used to protect crops, such as corn and soy, that has been shown to harm pollinators.  The bill would ban seeds that have been treated with neonicotinoids by Jan. 1, 2029. It would also ban other uses of the pesticide, such as spraying the substance on certain types of crops or any ornamental plants, and on any crop while it’s in bloom.  The Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets could issue an exemption order if a farmer experienced environmental or agricultural emergencies, which would involve a pest presenting “an imminent risk of significant harm, injury, or loss to agricultural crops.” The farmer would only be eligible for those exemptions if no other legal pesticide would alleviate the situation. H.706 mirrors a similar law in New York, and lawmakers and farmers hope that the two states will produce enough demand to spur suppliers to offer seeds that are not coated with neonicotinoids. It includes a provision that would repeal Vermont’s ban on neonicotinoid treated seeds if New York’s ban is repealed.  The bill has received some pushback from the Scott administration. Members of the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets have expressed concern about the regulation’s potential impact on the state’s dairy farmers, who rely on corn and soybean crops. S.301 makes a number of miscellaneous changes to agricultural law. Among them, it adds certain types of rodenticides to a list of restricted use pesticides, specifically those that include brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difenacoum or difethialone.  It also prohibits pet shops from selling dogs, cats and wolf hybrids unless the pet shop lawfully offered animals for sale prior to July 1, 2024 and meets several qualifications. The measure is intended to eliminate the sale of puppies from puppy mills in Vermont.  S.301 also bans the sale of “paws or internal organs of a black bear separate from the animal as a whole” unless the organs are an authorized taxidermy product.  In a press release, the advocacy group Animal Wellness Action celebrated the passage of the bill because of the provision related to black bear organs and stated that the measure could help reduce black bear poaching.  H.81, a bill that would have allowed Vermont farmers and loggers to independently repair their agricultural equipment, has died after lawmakers in the House and Senate failed to agree on its details.  Lawmakers introduced the bill last year, and they were quickly met with an onslaught of lobbying opposition from national interest groups and equipment manufacturers. The bill would have compelled manufacturers like John Deere, Caterpillar or Tigercat to offer the manuals, codes, diagnostics and equipment parts necessary to repair farm and logging equipment at fair market value. “In the last couple of weeks before adjournment, a lot of language changed on the Senate end and became much more favorable to manufacturers,” Sen. Irene Wrenner, D-Chittenden North, who presented the bill on the Senate floor, told VTDigger.  House lawmakers tried to change the bill to what they had originally passed, but the Senate declined to take it up again.  ",

        "description": "A bill that would address the long-standing problem of timber theft in Vermont is headed to the desk of Gov. Phil Scott, now that it has cleared both chambers of the legislature. Senators on Tuesday unanimously passed the legislation, which was given the final stamp of approval in the House on Wednesday. Sen. Richard Westman, R-Lamoille, who presented H.614 on the floor last week, said he encountered timber theft during his first term in the Legislature. While carpooling home with another lawmaker in 1983, he said, the passenger pointed to a hillside property of a homebound woman in her late 80s and said loggers were working there, even though the woman didn’t know what was happening.  The two lawmakers asked for a check from the mill where the loggers sold the stolen logs, and gave the money back to the elderly landowner.  “She cried,” recalled Westman, who said he was 23 years old at the time of the incident. “She didn’t have very much, but she owned this 60-acre piece of land.” For decades, unscrupulous loggers have been showing up at Vermonters’ doors to offer their services, but instead taking more trees than the two parties agreed upon. They often leave properties with a mess that landowners have to clean up.  While some victims have won court cases and thousands of dollars in judgments against such loggers, few, if any, have been paid their court-ordered damages. The loggers have continued to operate, and the judicial system in Vermont has failed to stop the activity or find restitution for the victims.  Reasons for this failure include an overburdened court docket and lack of experience prosecuting crimes related to timber theft. Some state officials have recently shown interest in handling the cases, though: Earlier this year, Attorney General Charity Clark brought a civil lawsuit against one logging family on behalf of five victims on the grounds of consumer fraud.  “The issue of people going onto other people’s lands and stealing timber has long been a problem,” Westman told lawmakers. “And it’s a really hard problem to deal with.” This session, victims of timber theft have called on lawmakers to crack down on the activity. In response, lawmakers introduced H.614, which would categorize timber theft as a type of land improvement fraud. It also includes a number of other measures, such as increasing fines and jail time for timber theft and adding loggers who have stolen timber to an existing home improvement fraud registry.  H.614 would limit the offenders’ employment opportunities. In order to earn money for logging, they would have to work for an unaffiliated company or person who does not have any fraud violations against them. Finally, the person would need to either disclose their conviction to their new employer or post a $250,000 surety bond with the Attorney General’s Office.  Some who want to see change are still skeptical that the measures included in the bill would effectively change loggers’ operations. Loggers who have stolen timber in the past have ignored court orders and requirements from state officials for years with impunity.  To address enforcement, the bill would require the Attorney General’s Office to craft a report, due to the Legislature in January 2025, detailing the current enforcement mechanisms that apply to timber theft and potential ways to improve enforcement. H.614 is expected to head to the governor’s desk for his signature or veto in the coming days. Correction: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized Wednesday’s legislative action. ",

        "description": "This is the second story in a two-part series that examines the increasingly inflamed debate about wildlife management in Vermont. Part I of the series looked at the voices that are most often heard in the Legislature and in Vermont media. This story analyzes the opinions of the broader public and asks whether it’s possible to find common ground.  MONTPELIER — In late February, a collection of people who care passionately about Vermont’s wildlife — and disagree about how to manage it — crowded into the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee room. Over two days, lawmakers heard from roughly 60 members of the public on S.258, which would change wildlife governance in Vermont. During a break, Sen. Chris Bray, D-Addison, the committee chair, observed conversations between people with opposing viewpoints that, at first, appeared tense. But over a period of hours, he said, the conversations turned amiable.  “Then we adjourned for the morning, and I would come back down the hall 15 minutes later, and they’re still talking in the hallway,” he said. “To me, all those kinds of real conversations, back and forth, are a great success.” Bray, the bill’s lead sponsor, hopes the legislation will spur productive conversations like the ones that took place in his committee room — especially amid increasing tension about wildlife management in Vermont. For Bray and other bill supporters, this goal appears challenging, especially considering that the debate about wildlife management has often been called a culture war.  In this perceived dichotomy, one side advocates for wildlife and the other advocates for hunting rights. But a review of studies, interviews and written commentaries shows that Vermonters’ views on wildlife are often more complex than the public dialogue shows. Lawmakers crafted S.258 to address what its supporters describe as a disparity on Vermont’s Fish and Wildlife Board, which creates regulations for hunting, trapping and fishing. Those who want to change the system argue that the board, which is made up of hunters, trappers and anglers, unfairly prioritizes the interests of those groups. The bill cleared the Senate earlier this session with enough votes to override a likely veto from Gov. Phil Scott, but it appears to have stalled in the other chamber. Members of the House Environment and Energy Committee have stopped taking testimony on it after realizing they may not have the two-thirds majority — 100 or more votes — to override. If the measure becomes law, it would give more voice to people who want hunting regulations to prioritize the needs of wildlife, especially as species adapt to stressors such as climate change and habitat loss.  Specifically, it would allow the Legislature to appoint two people to board, expanding authority beyond the governor in hopes of diversifying the appointments, and it would shift the authority to enact wildlife management policy from the board to the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department. All board members would be required to meet a list of qualifications and participate in training. The bill would also ban the controversial practice of hunting coyotes with dogs. The measure has elicited concern and opposition from many hunters and trappers, who defend the current composition of the board and see the bill as a threat to practices that define their way of life. Hunters and trappers often argue that their activities help manage wildlife populations, and are therefore beneficial to the ecosystem. That’s where Bray sees common ground. “The thing I came to appreciate, as I listened to — I really hate saying it this way, but, ‘both sides’ — is that wildlife conservation was by far the thing that united them most strongly,” Bray said. “I think they had so much more in common than they realized.” If not in two separate camps, where do most Vermonters stand? Wildlife professionals have looked at this question from a number of angles. First, by license numbers: Participation in hunting has waned compared to 30 years ago, though it saw a slight resurgence during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to data provided by the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department.  In 1994, Vermonters held about 87,000 hunting licenses. (That figure includes combination licenses for fishing and hunting and excludes permanent and lifetime hunting licenses, for which the department does not have data until 2017.) That number dropped to 73,500 in 2004, then fell again to 62,000 in 2014.  In 2023, some 44,000 people purchased hunting licenses — about half the number of people who bought new licenses in 1994. Another 23,000 who held permanent or lifetime licenses hunted that year, bringing the total to about 70,000 Vermont residents who could legally hunt, or 11% of the state’s population. Surveys also illustrate Vermonters’ views on the topic. In 2022, the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department conducted a telephone survey of more than 800 people to assess their opinions about wildlife management. When they asked whether Vermonters approve of trapping, the answer depended on the intention of the trapper and whether the activity was regulated.  For example, 91% strongly or moderately approved of trapping to help with wildlife restoration, while 70% approved if the activity reduced damage to crops and gardens. Only 26% approved of trapping for recreation.  Interviewers split the group of respondents, asking one half if they approved of “trapping” (42% approved) and the other half if they approved of “regulated trapping” (60% approved).  Sam Bliss, a postdoctoral fellow in Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of Vermont, considers hunting through the lens of food access. He told lawmakers earlier this year that roughly 14% of food consumed in Vermont comes from “non-market” sources, such as gardens, food pantries, foraging, fishing and hunting.  His survey of 400 Vermonters found that about 20% of households in Vermont get some of their food from a family member who hunts, though just a sliver of all food consumed in Vermont — about 1% — comes from hunting.  For a lot of hunters, the activity isn’t about food access, he said in an interview. It’s about spending time in nature, or continuing a family or cultural tradition.   “But for some residents of Vermont, it is really important for food access,” he said. “This tends to be folks who are low income and have a tradition of hunting, have been hunting for their whole lives, so that they're good at it. And they have the necessary knowledge and gear to have success hunting, because that's a big thing.” Another subset of Vermonters, Bliss told VTDigger, prefer to get their meat from hunting for ethical reasons: to avoid buying factory-farmed meat at the grocery store.  While some Vermonters have taken up hunting for the first time in recent years, numbers and anecdotes suggest that, over time, Vermont’s culture may be slowly shifting away from certain types of hunting.  Author Marc Boglioli stayed with people at hunting camps and conducted a number of interviews with Vermonters for his 2009 book, “A Matter of Life and Death: Hunting in Contemporary Vermont.” Asked in an interview whether conversations were heated when he conducted his research, Boglioli raised the then-controversial issue of coyote tournaments, when hunters would win prizes for killing the most coyotes.  The tournament violated an ethic of hunting Boglioli said was common among hunters: You eat, or use, what you kill. Boglioli said he personally “stuffed a lot of coyotes into Glad bags after those tournaments and put them in the garbage.” “It was probably the first time that there was a chink in the armor of the hunting community itself around the ethics of hunting,” he said, “because a lot of hunters weren't cool with it.”  The competitions divided hunting families, he said — and caught the attention of wildlife advocates. The Legislature banned the tournaments in 2018.  A Vermont chapter of a 2018 report, called America’s Wildlife Values — administered by two associations of fish and wildlife agencies to help their members make decisions based on the public’s interests — defines Vermonters’ values related to wildlife more broadly, using four categories. Traditionalists, the report states, believe that wildlife should be used and managed for the benefit of people. Mutualists believe “wildlife are part of our social network and that we should live in harmony.” Pluralists prioritize the values differently depending on the context, and those who are “distanced” believe that wildlife issues are less relevant to them.  In Vermont, 25% of people are traditionalists, 34% are mutualists, 29% are pluralists and 12% are distanced, according to the report. Those values stay relatively consistent across age groups, income groups and education levels.  Even people who hold different values about wildlife are not always in separate camps. Former Fish & Wildlife Commissioner Louis Porter wrote in a 2018 report that there is “likely significant overlap” in Vermont between traditionalists and mutualists “in that both groups generally value wildlife and support the conservation of species.” In a survey conducted in the state in 2015, he noted, 91% of respondents thought it was important for people to be able to participate in “wildlife-related outdoor recreation such as hunting, fishing and wildlife viewing.\" That figure was up from 80% in 2000.  “Even more compelling, 81% of the general public and 86% of hunters and anglers strongly believed that threatened and endangered species must be protected, up from 37% in 1995,” Porter wrote.  Joshua Morse, a Ph.D. student at the University of Vermont’s Rubenstein School for Environment and Natural Resources (and the public relations officer for the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department), has found overlaps in wildlife values, too. In his dissertation, which he defended in March, Morse used stories to assess Vermonters’ relationships with coyotes.  Morse wrote that he is “concerned by the polarization” in policy arenas, media coverage “and even research into” the reasons that nature matters to people. “Human-human conflict around the elements of nature we value is increasingly recognized as a barrier to human-wildlife coexistence and management in its own right,” he wrote.  Morse chose coyotes because they are often the center of controversy about how wildlife impacts human wellbeing, he wrote. While coyotes are not native to Vermont, they replaced wolves, which colonists extirpated from the landscape through hunting, Morse wrote. They are now considered a naturalized species and not invasive. In 150 interviews collected with the help of the Vermont Folklife Center and high school students, Morse looked at whether coyotes were adding or detracting from Vermonters’ lives. He found that more people talked about coyotes as contributors rather than detractors. For example, a grandfather spoke about howling back and forth with coyotes during a pandemic winter.  However, when people spoke about negative relationships with coyotes, “it was in these really high-tension categories — things like mental health, or sense of security, or impacts to agriculture,” he said.  The results weren’t binary, and Morse took care to capture the complexities that people expressed. He broke the values into three categories: “instrumental,” or prioritizing human needs in relationship with nature; “intrinsic,” in which people believed nature mattered separately from humans; and “relational,” which addresses the relationship that people want to have with nature.  People spoke about the species’ impact on them, the importance of coyotes for their own sake, and the awareness of an ongoing relationship with coyotes at the individual level and population level.  “All of that is out there,” Morse said. “But much more interesting to me is that, often, those three things, or some combination of them, exist in the same person.” Some major environmental groups active across Vermont accept certain types of hunting, and many hunters approve of increased regulations on the activity. The Nature Conservancy, an environmental organization that protects and conserves land across the United States and elsewhere, opens much of its land to hunting, though the organization does not take a position for or against the activity.  “The most common reason for allowing hunting and/or fishing on Conservancy preserves is to maintain or restore the integrity of sensitive species and biological communities,” the organization’s website states. “Another common reason the Conservancy allows hunting and/or fishing on some of our preserves is to respect the practices and cultural traditions of human communities.” Brenna Galdenzi, president of Protect Our Wildlife Vermont, has supported bans on trapping, coyote hounding and certain types of hunting. Still, she isn’t trying to ban all hunting, she said, noting that her organization has never participated in a Fish and Wildlife Board meeting about turkey rules or deer rules. Rather, she wants to see more regulations that show animals respect. “I think most hunting in Vermont is done for cultural reasons, for food, as a way of life,” she said in an interview. “That is never something that we would ever fight or oppose or look to change.” Mike Covey, executive director of the Vermont Traditions Coalition, which opposes S.258, said many hunters and trappers care sincerely about wildlife conservation. “When it becomes a part of our life on a very real and deep and meaningful level, it gives us that incentive to really care about outcomes, and really care about ensuring that we have healthy populations of these animals on the landscape,” he said. Some hunters even appear amenable to S.258.  In a recent commentary for VTDigger, Alex Smith, a member of the Bristol Conservation Commission, wrote that he has “serious skin in the game as it pertains to the future of hunting and fishing.” “They are the most important things in my life outside of my family,” he wrote. Still, he defended what others have called an “anti-hunting” bill. Wildlife, he wrote, does not only belong to people who hunt it.  “Rather than property, wildlife is to be ‘held in trust by the state for all citizens.’ This is law — not my opinion,” he wrote. “It is hard for me to acknowledge that and make an objective argument against having the Wildlife Board consist of a more diverse set of viewpoints. How this affects sportsmen/women will depend on the people who eventually occupy that board.” If S.258 passes — which seemed less and less likely in early May — many people expect that the governor would appoint 14 people from the hunting and trapping community to the Fish and Wildlife Board, and the Legislature would appoint two people viewed as wildlife advocates.  But Bray said the wording of the bill prevents politics from playing such a large role. Rather, he said, it's a recipe for balance, requiring every entity with the authority to appoint members to the board — the speaker of the House, the Senate’s Committee on Committees and the governor — to appoint people with certain qualifications.  “Some people have said to me, ‘oh, that's going to end up being 14 to two.’ And I hope not, because everyone's going to come through the same criteria,” Bray said.  Those criteria would include having “a knowledge of fish and wildlife biology, ecology, and the ethics of fish and wildlife management,” as well as the capacity to have “balanced viewpoints” and “recognize the challenges to wildlife and habitat caused by climate change, including an unprecedented loss of biodiversity, and prioritize the value of science in the work to conserve, protect, and restore natural ecosystems,” the bill states. The bill is unlikely to clear the House this year. Rep. Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury, chair of the House Environment and Energy Committee — which currently has possession of the bill — said she expects to raise the issue again in a future session. If S.258 fails to pass the House, lawmakers would need to start from the beginning on a new bill.  Still, the conversations about that have taken place this session have served a purpose, she said, despite the bill’s increasingly narrow path to become law. “I think folks are starting to understand each other better on these issues,” Sheldon said. “You know, there's issues we need to address, but I think there's room to address them. The majority of Vermonters, I think, can understand that we continue to be in support of hunting and those kinds of engagements with our wildlife, but that there's also room for other voices at the table.” Sitting in his committee room in early April, Bray ruminated over the controversy surrounding S.258. He said he didn’t want the bill to divide Vermonters.  “I just have never seen anyone who's at a table having a conversation lose anything by letting someone else join the conversation,” he said. “It's not a zero sum game.” ",

        "description": "In the last week, three of the legislative session’s biggest climate bills passed out of their second chamber, and are likely to head to the governor’s desk soon.  Those bills include S.213, which would establish a new state permitting system for building in river corridors, S.259, which would require big oil companies to pay for damages from climate change in Vermont and H.289, a bill that would update the state’s renewable energy standard by requiring utilities to make a quicker transition to renewable energy.  Gov. Phil Scott and members of his administration have publicly expressed concern about all three of the bills. Asked whether Scott would veto them, Jason Maulucci, Scott’s spokesperson, said the governor hasn’t made a final decision.  “We’re at the point in the session where things change rather quickly in bills, so he will reserve judgment until final versions reach his desk,” Maulucci said, referring VTDigger to Julie Moore, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, for the administration’s positions on S.213 and S.259.  While the two bills are very different, Moore said the administration’s opposition to both can be boiled down to a similar sentiment: “The principle — in both of these cases — is good and important. But that doesn’t mean you should just charge headlong into it without doing all of the groundwork necessary for it to be successful,” she said.  S.213, which passed the Senate in March and passed the House on May 3, addresses development in river corridors, sets new standards for wetland protection and increases dam safety measures. Supporters of the bill say it’s an important policy that will protect Vermonters from events like the July 2023 floods.  Lauren Oates, a lobbyist at the Nature Conservancy Vermont, said Vermont has experienced flooding with more regularity and severity since Tropical Storm Irene hit the state in 2011.  “We know that that trauma and those damages, physical or otherwise, are going to continue to be incurred,” she said. “And this bill, the Flood Safety Act, is the bill that we have that uses some of the best available science, and then has come up with a cohesive and semi comprehensive suite of solutions that recognize our flood problem.” Moore contends that the bill does not give her agency the money or time it needs to build out the new permitting program. While the agency asked for roughly 15 new staff members — and the bill would create 15 new positions — “it only provides enough funding for 11 of those 15 positions,” she said.  While acknowledging the Legislature’s financial challenges, Moore said lawmakers haven’t expressed “any real interest in adjusting the scope of the bill to match the resources they do have available.” Moore is also concerned that Vermonters may be caught off-guard by the regulation, which could apply to as many as 45,000 parcels in 2028, when the permitting system would kick in. She said she thinks the process could benefit from additional time.  Oates, who has been working closely with lawmakers on S.213, said the bill balances both limited resources and the urgency of flood-related disasters with the agency’s needs.  “The worst case scenario of an aggressive timeline is the agency has to come back to the Legislature and ask for more time to do this well and to do this right. The worst case scenario of an extended timeline is more homes are put in harm’s way,” Oates said. S.259, which passed the Senate in April and passed the House on Monday, would use the “polluter pays” model, requiring the world’s biggest oil companies to pay for damages that their product has caused in Vermont by way of climate change. The money would be deposited into a Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program Fund.  Oil companies are expected to put up a fight, and the result could mean an expensive litigation process for Vermont.  “I harbor no illusions that Big Oil is going to do anything other than a full court press against this bill, on whichever state or states act first,” Moore said. She recommended that lawmakers research the idea of a climate change superfund, write a report on it, and then determine how to proceed next year.  “I think, ultimately, you get one bite at this apple and want to make sure you’re doing it in a way that will withstand judicial scrutiny,” she said. “And I’m not sure we’re there yet.” Ben Edgerly Walsh, a lobbyist with the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, argued that a lawsuit would be worth it if Vermont won. While no one knows yet how much money the bill could bring to the state, “what we do know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is that the funds that would come to Vermont, if we are successful, would be orders of magnitude more than any potential cost to defend a lawsuit against this,” he said. Walsh said the bill would “clearly be good for Vermonters, because the status quo is, we have to shoulder virtually all of the costs on our own with no contribution from these enormously profitable companies.” H.289, which passed the House in March and passed the Senate on Tuesday, would update the state’s renewable energy standard by requiring utilities to buy renewable energy at a faster pace.  Earlier this year, the Department of Public Service, part of Scott’s administration, gave lawmakers a cost estimate that the bill’s advocates — and later, the state’s Joint Fiscal Office — said was likely too high.  Asked about the administration’s position on the bill, Moore referred VTDigger to the department. TJ Poor, director of the department’s regulated utility planning division, who has worked closely on the bill, said the department still opposes it. Poor said the department would have preferred that lawmakers consider its own proposal to update the renewable energy standard, which includes a slower timeline to using local renewable sources.  “We need to clean up our grid as fast as possible, as quickly as possible, as affordably as possible, because we’re going to lean into it far more” as the state electrifies, said Johanna Miller, a lobbyist at the Vermont Natural Resources Council. Some supporters of the three bills see a pattern in Scott’s recent and likely future vetoes. Moore said, despite the fact that the administration “isn’t full-throated in supporting any of these three bills as they come out of the Legislature,” her agency is committed to fighting climate change and protecting Vermonters from its impacts.  The Legislature hasn’t been willing to compromise, she said, and hasn’t fully resourced the work it’s endeavoring to assign to her agency.  “As a result, you end up with this tension that is convenient to portray as for or against climate action, when in reality, I think it’s about trying to make sure we are able to do the work we need to do well,” she said.  Miller said she’s interested in seeing the administration come up with its own plan to address climate change.  Referencing S.213, Oates, with the Nature Conservancy, asked what the alternative would be.  “What are we doing, then, as a state to make it safer, to make it less expensive with respect to flood related damages?” she said. “What is the plan to create a more flood resilient or flood prepared state in the absence of this bill?”   ",

        "description": "This is the first story in a two-part series that examines the increasingly inflamed debate about wildlife management in Vermont. Part I of the series looks at the voices that are most often heard in the Legislature and in Vermont media. Part II analyzes the opinions of the broader public and asks whether it’s possible to find common ground.  MONTPELIER — In early April, more than a dozen people stood at one end of a carpeted room in the Statehouse holding signs with slogans such as “hunting coyotes with hounds IS legalized dog fighting” and “all voices matter.” At the other end of the room stood Mike Covey, executive director of the Vermont Traditions Coalition, which advocates for rural interests in the Statehouse. He was observing and sometimes recording video. Two reporters stood in the middle, the only other people in the room.  Brenna Galdenzi, who was standing among the group holding signs, addressed the room. “I just want to take a minute to say that (we) are not animal rights terrorists, extremists. We are not ‘antis.’ We are not invasive species taking over Vermont,” said Galdenzi, president of Protect Our Wildlife, a Stowe-based organization that has advocated for increased hunting regulations.  Her ad-libbed comments at the press conference, held to support a bill related to wildlife management, show how polarized conversations about wildlife management have become. Across Vermont, people’s experiences and views related to wildlife come in shades of gray. But at the Statehouse and in the press, they often appear in black and white.  In the Legislature, much of the conversation has been focused on the membership of the Fish and Wildlife Board. Currently, its 14 citizen members, appointed by the governor, create and approve all of the hunting, trapping and fishing regulations for Vermont’s game species. The board is typically made up of active hunters, trappers and anglers.  As wildlife adapts to stressors such as climate change and habitat loss, a growing range of people want to see the animals’ needs prioritized over those of hunters. They argue that the board unfairly prioritizes the interests of hunters, who represented about 10% of Vermont’s population in 2023, according to data from the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department. In the past few years, the dispute has become increasingly pitched. Some influential lawmakers have moved to address that perceived disparity, along with complaints about the impacts of certain hunting and trapping practices on landowners.  Their proposals have raised the hackles of many hunters and trappers, who defend the current composition of the board and see ongoing debate as a threat to their way of life.  This legislative session, the conversation has focused on S.258, a bill that would significantly tweak Vermont wildlife management by adding two new members to the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Board whose primary backgrounds would not likely be hunting and trapping. The bill would also ban the controversial practice of hunting coyotes with hounds.  Perhaps most significantly, S.258 would shift rulemaking authority from the board to the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department. Staffed with 150 people, many of whom are wildlife biologists, the department currently provides advice and recommendations to the board, which are largely accepted. When the bill reached the Senate floor earlier this year, Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, told lawmakers that the measure is “the biggest anti-hunting bill that’s ever reached the Senate, in my opinion.”   “If this bill passes, this is the end of hunting as we know it in the state of Vermont,” Ingalls said.  Ingalls and other opponents of the bill argue that people who hunt, trap and fish have the appropriate experience to craft regulations related to those activities.  Vermonters who have grown up in a hunting culture often describe the potential for humans to be a healthy part of the ecosystem. Hunting has the capacity not only to provide food for families and protection of people and property, but also to serve as a valuable wildlife conservation tool, they argue.  Additionally, hunters express concern about newcomers to Vermont who have had the resources to buy land that is rapidly growing more expensive. They feel that those new residents are sometimes advocating for change before understanding the cultural nuances of their new home. “It’s been expressed recently that some folks on that side feel it’s a culture war,” said Covey, of the Vermont Traditions Coalition. “And I would agree with that.” This framing troubles Sen. Chris Bray, D-Addison, the lead sponsor of S.258. Bray said he’s been concerned “about not wanting this to become so divisive that it would fracture community, because I think that it’s something we have in Vermont still.” The bill cleared the Senate in March with enough votes to override a likely veto from Gov. Phil Scott, but it appears support is waning in the House, where it’s currently in the hands of the Energy and Environment Committee. On Wednesday, Rep. Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury and the committee’s chair, indicated that the House may not have enough votes to override a veto.  “We’re not going to move it if it doesn’t look like it has a future,” Sheldon said in an interview on May 1.  In 2022, the Legislature passed a bill that banned wanton waste of wildlife, requiring humans to eat, mount or skin all animals killed through hunting or trapping, except coyotes. It took three years to push that change through, Sheldon said.  “I think we took some very helpful testimony on this — even though we have stopped taking testimony — in terms of, what are the things that people are afraid of in this conversation? And how do we address those the next time we bring it up?” Sheldon said. The North American Model of Wildlife Conservation, which guides state wildlife agencies in the U.S., is based in part on the Public Trust Doctrine. The legal premise holds that natural resources, including fish and wildlife, are not owned by any particular entity, but rather held in trust for present and future generations by state and federal governments. In short: Wildlife belongs to all people. But what does it mean to hold wildlife in public trust when the public can’t agree about how to manage it? Vermont is not alone in contemplating this question. Washington, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona are among the states engaged in similar debates.  “These changing attitudes and cultural interests related to wildlife conservation seem to be playing out across the country,” said John Austin, who directs the Wildlife Division at the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department.  In Washington state, Kim Thorburn, an avid birdwatcher, made headlines in 2023 when Gov. Jay Inslee did not reappoint her to the state’s Fish and Wildlife Commission. He had expected her to advocate against certain hunting policies, but Thorburn surprised him when she defended them, she told VTDigger. She served on the commission for eight years, but in the last two, the panel became “absolutely packed and overrun” with animal welfare advocates, she said. The opposite situation appears to have occurred in Colorado. Gary Skiba, who was appointed to that state’s commission by Gov. Jared Polis in July 2023, relinquished his seat in March after it looked unlikely that the Colorado Senate would approve his appointment. A former wildlife program manager for an environmental group and state wildlife biologist, he was opposed by “a growing chorus of recreation and hunting groups — along with commissioners in the hunter-reliant counties of Grand and Teller,” according to the Colorado Sun.  In Vermont, staff at the Fish & Wildlife Department said that they often feel caught in the middle between people who want to protect the right to hunt and people who argue for more hunting regulations. Asked what the department’s mission might say about the divide, Commissioner Chris Herrick referenced the Public Trust Doctrine.  “We hold all wildlife in trust for everyone, and for future generations,” he said. “That’s it.” Galdenzi, from Protect Our Wildlife, is far from the only person in Vermont who wants to see more restrictions on hunting and trapping. Organizations such as Vermont Wildlife Patrol, Animal Wellness Action, the Humane Society and Project Coyote are all active in advocating for updated wildlife policies in the Green Mountain State.  But when hunters speak about the animal welfare movement — and when reporters in Vermont document it — Galdenzi’s name is often the one that surfaces. A photo of a trapped bobcat, its paw crushed and bloody, sparked the fire for Galdenzi, she said. She was volunteering for a group called Green Mountain Animal Defenders in 2010, which was focused on banning trapping, she said. Soon after, she founded Protect Our Wildlife. “It caused me to go on this path of like — no, this is inflicting prolonged suffering to an animal. This is not hunting. This is animal cruelty,” she told VTDigger in an interview.  People have become proponents for change in Vermont’s wildlife management for a variety of reasons.  Some are concerned about non-target species and pets that have been killed in traps (though at least some of these instances have occurred because of traps that were set illegally). Others are fed up with the behavior of hunting dogs, who have traversed onto posted property. Collectively, they feel the board is not open to addressing their concerns. “I have seen folks excited to get involved with wildlife management, and to share their knowledge and experience with the board, and then give up and not attend meetings in the future because they feel that their voices are not heard, and their perspectives are not valued by the current system,” said Bob Galvin, the Vermont state director for the nonprofit Animal Wellness Action and the Center for a Humane Economy, at the April press conference.  Over time, as Galdenzi and other advocates have taken their concerns to the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Board, they describe meeting repeated obstacles.  Galdenzi said she has petitioned the board twice for regulated coyote seasons — currently, the animals can be hunted every day of the year. She pointed to studies that show that coyote populations stay stable even when humans try to manage them. Nothing came of the efforts, she said. “The system right now is just impenetrable,” she said.  Asked about the petition for coyote seasons, Herrick, the commissioner of the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department, said the internal conversation about how to advise the board on petitions “always ends up being a serious discussion.” Staff at the department look at a number of factors, including the impacts on both the wildlife and on humans. “It’s not a 10-minute meeting with a few people. Oftentimes, we’ll say we’re gonna take a month, maybe two months to really dig into this,” he said.  Those who are frustrated with the system feel that the department, despite its deliberations, still does not consider the merits of their arguments.  Indeed, Herrick himself told lawmakers at a Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee hearing in February that “hearing every voice does not mean doing everything they say.” “I’ve used this example, and I don’t mean it to be condescending in any way, but I have kids that are grown up now,” he said. “I certainly listened to them growing up, but I didn’t do what they said every time because they weren’t always right.” Galdenzi and others said that feeling unheard is what led them to bring their ideas to lawmakers in the Statehouse, who were more receptive. Bray, who chairs the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee, told VTDigger that “folks who are oriented to animal welfare have been the folks who have come forward” to talk about a variety of issues since he started in the Legislature in 2007. “It made me think about things I hadn’t thought about before,” he said.  Bray has also adjusted bills based on feedback from the hunting community, he said. He used an example from 2022, when lawmakers in Bray’s committee introduced a trio of bills that, together, would have banned leghold traps and hunting coyotes with hounds while stripping the board of its authority to make regulations, leaving it with only advisory power. After hearing a large volume of testimony from hunters and trappers, lawmakers rolled the bills back. The version that became law required the board to create new rules for coyote hounding and trapping.  Last summer, the Fish and Wildlife Board completed that process, submitting the new rules to the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules (LCAR), which is charged with approving state regulations created by the executive branch.  Then came more controversy: Members of LCAR, including Bray, made four objections to the rules, saying they didn’t meet the law’s intent. For example, they argued that a new rule to require GPS collars on hunting hounds still wouldn’t give hunters enough control over their dogs to effectively avoid conflicts with landowners.  Members of the Fish and Wildlife Board voted to pass the rules anyway — prompting a lawsuit from Protect Our Wildlife. While a judge denied the organization’s request for immediate action, the case remains pending.  With his concerns still unresolved after the yearslong process, Bray responded with S.258.   In practice, the bill would alter the makeup and authority of the Fish and Wildlife Board, establish criteria for board members and ban coyote hunting with hounds. But both parties see a larger meaning in the bill: evidence that the other side was unwilling to compromise. To Bray, it feels like “a Rorschach test, in that what people see in it is what they bring to it.”  Many of the concerns that hunters and trappers have brought to him aren’t directly related to his proposal, he said.  “The response to the bill is not an entirely rational response. It’s an emotional response,” he said. “And the chief emotion I sense is fear. And I think that the fear part is a fear of loss of something.” A strong early spring sun shone on the day of the bill supporters’ press conference, drawing people outside to bask on the front steps of the Statehouse, including Bray, who sat to take a rest amid a packed meeting schedule. Covey, with the Vermont Traditions Coalition, eyed Bray warily as Covey sat to answer a reporter’s questions.  “I think that this community at large has been such a huge part of the Vermont landscape,” Covey said, referring to hunters and trappers. “There was a time where it was just kind of accepted that it had value.”  He worries that may not be the case anymore.  Marc Boglioli, author of “A Matter of Life and Death: Hunting in Contemporary Vermont,” told VTDigger that he sees the hunting debate as an example of a dynamic playing out more broadly in Vermont, in which people who didn’t grow up near hunting are moving to the state. Boglioli is an associate professor of anthropology at Drew University in New Jersey, but lives with his family in New Haven, Vermont. Vermont’s economy has relied on tourists and “outsiders” since the early 20th century, he said, and the mix of urban and rural perspectives has “made, obviously, Vermont really cool.” But the Covid-19 pandemic caused an “unanticipated and unimaginable” shift in the volume of newcomers.  “It’s like you turned the clock ahead maybe 10 or 15 years,” he said. That acceleration has caused rural Vermonters to second-guess, for example, driving around with a deer visible in the back of a truck, or hanging up a deer in their front lawn, wary of the “moral suspicion” of new onlookers, Boglioli said. “People’s interaction with animals becomes almost a metaphorical way for them to comment on their relationships with other people,” Boglioli said.  Galdenzi, who is originally from Connecticut, is familiar with the wariness toward newcomers. A meme that called her an “invasive species” circulated on the internet for a while, she said. She believes the argument that newcomers to the state are a threat to Vermont’s hunting ethic is overblown. Either way, some members of the hunting and trapping community felt the need to provide a window for outsiders into their world. In late 2023, members of the Vermont Trappers Association decided to try to shift the public narrative about trapping by making a 35-minute film, which they published earlier this year. As of mid-April, it had nearly 8,000 views on Youtube. “There’s been all this noise around (trapping), and we’ve been so quiet,” Covey said.  In its introduction, captions note that the film intended to address “a pivotal moment in Vermont’s fish and wildlife history.” It discusses trapping in the context of cultural tradition and identity before turning to misconceptions that trappers feel have been placed on them.  “These people are not what you think they are, and unfortunately the bad rap that sportsmen and sportswomen get is just from unfortunate things online that kind of get taken out of context,” Bree Furfey, a wildlife biologist at the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department, tells the camera. “We take joy in seeing an animal that we set a trap for in the trap, but we take no joy in killing it,” says Wes Mattern, an interviewee from Tunbridge. “It’s not like my quota for blood loss is filled today.” While the film was intended to convince the public of the activity’s merits, it was controversial in some circles, in part because some interviewees, including Vermont Fish & Wildlife staff wearing clothing with the department’s insignia, directed accusations at people who have tried to change the structure of wildlife management.  “I’m really concerned about the ongoing attack on (the) Fish & Wildlife Department,” said Herrick, the department’s commissioner. “We have some small groups, very vocal, that are trying to limit their ability to continue the great work that they’re doing.” Barbara Felitti, a member of Protect Our Wildlife, filed an ethics complaint about the participation of the Fish & Wildlife Department in the film, arguing that staff misused government resources on behalf of a special interest group. The complaint said the department showed preferential treatment “by maligning members of the non-trapping community” and propagated misinformation, particularly related to the role that furbearing animals play in spreading emerging infectious diseases.As of April 22, the state was actively investigating the complaint, according to an email exchange between Felitti and staff at the Department of Human Resources. Herrick declined to comment on the matter. Galdenzi has also taken issue with the film for what she describes as defamatory remarks about her organization allegedly doxxing individuals online and creating an unsafe working environment for Fish & Wildlife staff, two charges which Galdenzi denies. Others saw the need for the film. “There’s a reality out there, sometimes for farmers or others who — I guess the reality is not either known or experienced by the vast majority of consumers. And it’s important that that be reflected as people talk about the world of trapping,” Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman, a farmer who was interviewed in the trapping association’s film, told VTDigger. Zuckerman said he hosted an unplanned conversation earlier this year between a handful of people on opposite sides of the debate on a day when they all happened to be at the Statehouse.  While people who want to see more hunting restrictions have felt unheard by the Fish and Wildlife Board, Zuckerman had heard that board members and others felt that the advocates had sometimes questioned their morality in an uncomfortable way. Zuckerman spoke about the “really massively changing landscape” in the last four years, “where we’ve seen a pretty significant influx of new people in Vermont.” But he was heartened when he witnessed the conversation in his office between people with “highly divergent views” on the topic. The result, he felt, was productive. The divisiveness of national politics has started to infiltrate the wildlife management debate, he said, and that tenor is different from “the historically more respectful way that we’ve dealt with differences in Vermont.” “I think this issue, more than most, has become that way,” he said, “where everyone’s talking to a wall and nobody’s listening.” Corrections: An earlier version of this story misstated the residence of Marc Bogliogi and misidentified the type of disease at the center of an ethics complaint involving the Fish & Wildlife Department.

        "summary": "Oral rabies vaccine drops are planned for four northwest counties starting May 4.",

        "description": "Federal and state agencies will be bait-dropping oral rabies vaccine doses throughout northwest Vermont counties to counter a growing outbreak among wildlife. In a press release this week, officials with the Vermont Department of Health and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s wildlife services program said they plan to distribute more than 250,000 doses of an oral rabies vaccine in parts of Chittenden, Lamoille, Franklin and Grand Isle counties. It’s an expansion from last year, when roughly 38,000 doses were dropped throughout Chittenden County. This year’s early distribution, scheduled to begin on May 4, is in addition to an annual bait drop conducted each August. Rabies is a deadly viral disease that affects the brains of infected mammals. In Vermont, rabies is most often seen in raccoons, skunks, foxes, bats and woodchucks. Pets and livestock can also get the disease if they have not been vaccinated for rabies. While the state has seen a “significant increase of rabid animals” in Chittenden County over the past several years, according to the release, the outbreak is now impacting Franklin County, and state and federal officials are working to stave off the disease’s spread to other counties. Officials said in the press release that 51 animals in Chittenden County have tested positive for rabies since March 2022 — 10 of which have been identified this year. In Franklin County, five animals tested positive for the disease in March. The county had no cases of rabies among land animals in 2022 or 2023. The bait drop is designed to help prevent spread of rabies among wildlife, “protecting people and domestic animals who may come into contact with them,” said Dr. Natalie Kwit, a public health veterinarian with the health department. The sweet-smelling oral bait is expected to be dropped from low-flying planes in rural areas, by helicopter in suburban areas and by hand in more residential areas. The bait packs are not poisonous and are not harmful to people, pets or wildlife, but “if you find a bait pack, please don’t touch it unless necessary,” officials said in the press release. ",

        "description": "Fuel dealers in Vermont have asked the Public Utility Commission to specify the date at which they would be required to comply with a potential clean heat standard if the measure clears the Legislature next year.  At issue, they say, is the pricing for pre-buy fuel deliveries for the upcoming winter, which dealers typically offer from May until September. Lawmakers passed what’s often described as a blueprint for a clean heat standard during the 2023 legislative session. They directed the state’s Public Utility Commission to fully design the system, with a deadline to present a plan to the Legislature by Jan. 15, 2025. At that point, lawmakers would vote to implement it — or not.  In an April 25 filing to the commission, the Vermont Fuel Dealers Association said that dealers who sell heating oil, propane and kerosene must soon decide whether they’ll offer customers the option to pre-buy fixed price heating plans for the 2024-2025 winter. To make their decision, they said, they want to know when the clean heat standard would begin to apply to them, if it’s implemented. “Most local heating fuel dealers provide customers the opportunity to pre-buy their winter heating fuel or enter into fixed-price contracts,” the filing, written by attorney Joshua Diamond, states. “These popular price protection plans provide price stability, and in most years, they lower costs compared to fuel purchased only during the colder, winter months.” The goal of the proposed clean heat standard is to require businesses that bring heating-related fossil fuels into the state to help fund the transition to new heating systems that pollute less, thereby reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. It would operate through a credit market: Fossil fuel dealers would owe a certain number of credits to offset the emissions footprint associated with the fossil fuels they brought into the state. The requirements are expected to apply to a large percentage of fuel dealers in the state. Fuel dealers could fulfill their credit obligation by paying a fee or installing clean heat measures. Those measures would include improving a home’s energy efficiency by adding insulation or sealing windows, installing cold-climate electric heat pumps, advanced wood heat or solar hot water systems and using some biofuels.  Money collected from fuel dealers would be funneled back into the market and used to subsidize installation of clean heat measures. Other Vermont businesses and individuals could earn credits by installing clean heat measures, too. Fuel dealers have often expressed frustration about the uncertainty baked into the process. Until the commission’s process is farther along, fuel dealers won’t know how much the clean heat standard will change the cost of bringing their product into the state.  Matt Cota, a lobbyist for the fuel industry and owner of Meadow Hill Consulting, serves on the Technical Advisory Group, a collection of stakeholders who are helping to advise the commission. Some of the advisory group members have interpreted Act 18 — the Affordable Heat Act, which put the clean heat standard in motion — to mean that fuel dealers would need to pay into the system beginning in January 2025, Cota said.   Others believe the fuel dealers would begin owing credits in January 2026, at the earliest, because the Legislature likely wouldn’t finalize the clean heat standard until the end of the 2025 legislative session. What’s more, on April 18, the Technical Advisory Group unanimously recommended Jan. 1, 2026, as the earliest start date.  Rep. Laura Sibilia, I-Dover, told VTDigger on Wednesday that her understanding of the law, which she worked on throughout the 2023 session, is that fuel dealers would not be obligated until after the legislature approved the clean heat standard in 2025.  “I think the earliest I could start is 2026,” she said. As of Wednesday, the Public Utility Commission had not replied to the association’s request.  “We understand (the commission) can’t answer what the Legislature will do. That’s a crystal ball game,” Cota said. “We understand that they can’t tell us what the fee is now — they will tell us later, but not now. What they can tell us is whether, January 1, gallons delivered in the calendar year 2025 could become obligated, should this become law.” ",

        "description": "Kate Kampner is a reporter with Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program. When Peter Stickney walks along his cow paddocks in the morning, he notes the scattered patches of greener grass across the pasture. He knows what this means: It’s where his cows have peed.  So when the Rich Earth Institute, a Brattleboro organization focused on turning human urine into fertilizer, approached him to be a farm partner, Stickney said it was a no-brainer.  Stickney manages the Elm Lea Farm at The Putney School, a boarding high school in the Windham County town of the same name. For the past few years, alongside six other farms in Vermont and the Northeast, Stickney has been receiving treated urine from Rich Earth Institute to spray across the farmland at Elm Lea. The institute, its partners and others in the sustainability industry see the practice — dubbed “peecycling” in national headlines — as a cheap, easy and less-destructive method for fertilizing plants than synthetic fertilizer and as a way for people to rethink their views on whether human waste should really go to waste.  “We’re doing something that is somewhat disruptive and asking for people to look at things differently, change behaviors a little bit, sometimes around where they pee and why,” said Jed Blume, the institute’s development director.  For Stickney, it looks like this: Rich Earth workers haul a tank of treated urine to the farm on a big truck before filling a smaller tank that Stickney can tow across the farm with a tractor. “I could very quickly see how much darker green the grass was,” he said. “Dark green grass is happy grass — it means it has lots of nutrients. It’s very simple from my end, and it’s very soon that the results are visible, tangible.” Federal funders are on board. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program has given the group close to $325,000 since 2013 to explore urine’s role in fertilizer practices. “This is innovative research, and it could lead to something that could really help farmers in a sustainable way,” said Candice Huber, who oversees the program’s grants for projects in the Northeast pairing researchers and farmers. The Rich Earth Institute is going on its 12th year now, and the process of collecting urine and getting it to farms has evolved over time, Blume said. The institute says it collects urine from 230 donors, who use one of two methods provided by Rich Earth. Some donors pee into a funnel screwed to a jug, cap the container and bring it to a drop-off spot. Others own a specialized toilet with a trap installed in the bowl that connects to a separate plumbing line. Urine in the trap gets diverted to a tank that institute workers pump out once or twice a year. Next, the raw urine is transported from the collection site to a treatment center either on or off a farm. Through storage or pasteurization, at certain temperatures, the urine is treated to use as fertilizer. “The Rich Earth Institute has developed a computer-controlled pasteurizer with a high-efficiency heat exchanger to sanitize urine quickly and energy-efficiently,” the site says.  Finally, the urine is put on a tractor and put on crop fields.   “There’s been an interest both economically and environmentally in finding more sustainable, equitable, environmentally friendly ways of producing fertilizer, and since our bodies are all little fertilizer factories, folks are starting to connect the dots,” Blume said. “There’s multiple incentives for practicing nutrient recycling both economically and environmentally … The plants like it.”  Synthetic fertilizer is typically made of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium and often produced through two processes, the Haber-Bosch method and traditional mining. Treated urine, which contains all three of those nutrients, is a low-cost and sustainable fertilizer source, according to Rich Earth. One of the biggest concerns people have about urine fertilizer is pharmaceuticals, said Blume, but after doing a six-year research study with the University of Michigan and the University at Buffalo, the institute found “the pharmaceuticals don’t really accumulate in crop tissue at significant levels … Having that research energized us,” said Blume.  Blume said the practice is becoming more socially acceptable, too. “The global fertilizer industry has seen a lot of volatility with regards to pricing and sourcing,” he said. “Once you explain what the nutrients are, they seem to be really interested in a sustainable form (and) being able to access those nutrients affordably.”  Along with its farm partner program, the institute wants to offer people help through programs like “Urine My Garden,” which teaches gardeners to safely turn their pee into nutrients for their plants at home. And the institute is putting together a manual for farmers to do the same at scale. “We’ve developed a culture of practice around urine recycling,” said education director Julia Cavicchi.  Part of their pitch, to organizations such as the Lake Champlain Basin Program, involves almost philosophical benefits. “We can actually start to think about, how can we as humans come to heal the Earth with what our bodies produce in a way that is generous to the land,” Cavicchi said. “It’s a hopeful space to be working with in terms of using our bodies to heal.”  Kimmerly Nace had a similar mindset when she and Abraham Noe-Hays created Rich Earth in 2012. Nace remembers how her neighbors would show up to her home in those early days, containers of urine in hand. “It’s a very hopeful project,” said Nace, who no longer works at the institute. “People begin to feel that something that comes out of their body that’s normally been used as a waste can actually have value in agriculture.”  “Farmers have been really receptive partially because farmers don’t have any ick factor around urine — it’s not different than any other animal manure for farmers,” said Nace.  Nace is now the executive director of Brightwater Tools, a spinoff company that makes the technology Rich Earth uses to separate the urine from wastewater. Currently, she is working at a national level to shift the wastewater industry more toward nutrient recovery. “We really did intend from the very beginning to be disruptive. To really shake it up and say wait, what are we doing here?” Nace said, comparing urine reuse to windmills and electric cars.  Most of the grants Rich Earth has received from the USDA program are called partnership grants. The awards are capped at $30,000 and go to projects where researchers team up with a farmer to test hypotheses. Researchers set up their projects “so that they understand the needs of the farmer and how their work can really work on a farm.”  Rich Earth has had seven partnership grants since 2013, several at close to the max funding amount. “They had a lot of projects from us, and they’ve all been involving human fertilizer and testing it on crops and assessing the feasibility and bio-acidification,” Huber said. “Every year there’s discussion about the safety factors, the ability of using urine, as far as people who would be interested in eating products that are grown with that.”  Huber said the federal program has full confidence in the institute’s work: “They are very good with their research in the way that they put it all together, and it’s really very thorough. All the regulations are being followed through the state. Safety-wise we trust that process.”  Thor Retzlaff is the co-founder and chief marketing officer of Wasted*, a Burlington company that rents and sells water-saving porta-potties and toilets with eco-friendly features like bamboo toilet paper.  Retzlaff believes in the mission behind the Rich Earth, which his firm works with. More than a third of the company’s toilets divert urine from other waste. The company collects the urine, processes it and sends it to a local farm as fertilizer. “We’ve been working with the Rich Earth Institute and Brightwater tools since the conception of our company,” Retzlaff said. “They very much inspired us to go and start this thing.” Retzlaff, Brophy Tyree, and Taylor Zehren began the company after attending a virtual summit hosted by Rich Earth Urine in August 2020. Over the course of three days, Retzlaff said, “they essentially brought together the world’s minds to talk about how valuable piss is.”  He and the other co-founders wanted to take what they learned about urine diversion and combine it with a catchy business model. “From there what we did was identify Vermont as the state that allowed us to turn pee into fertilizer, so it was an obvious choice to move our business to Vermont,” he said. Wasted* toilets are easy to identify by their bright orange color. Retzlaff said urine-based fertilizer will catch on as evidence of its benefits grows. “There’s been a lot of data aggregating in the past 15 years that essentially says, ‘Hey, this is not only more sustainable than synthetic fertilizer but it’s more productive, it’s producing greater results. It’s a localized way of retaining the nutrients in any given ecosystem.’”  Or as Stickney, the farmer in Putney, put it: “It’s just the simplest thing in the world to do.” Corrections: An earlier version of this story misspelled Julia Cavicchi’s surname and misstated where the company Wasted* sends the urine it collects.
